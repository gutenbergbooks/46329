    <h2>
      THE CITY PHYSICIAN versus THE SWAMP DOCTOR.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he city physician,
      or the country doctor of an old-settled locality, with all the appliances
      of cultivated and refined life around them; possessing all the numberless
      conveniences and luxuries of the sick-room; capable of controlling the
      many adverse circumstances that exert such a pernicious influence upon
      successful practice; having at command the assistance, in critical and
      anomalous cases, of scientific and experienced coadjutors; the facilities
      of good roads; the advantages of comfortable dwellings, easy carriages,
      and the pleasures of commingling with a cultivated, mild, refined society,
      cannot fully realize and appreciate the condition of their less favoured,
      humble brethren, who, impelled by youthfulness, poverty, defective
      education, or the reckless spirit of adventure, have taken up their lot
      with society nearly in its primitive condition, and dispense the blessings
      of their profession to the inhabitants of a country, where the obscure
      bridle-path, the unbridged water-courses, the deadened forest trees, the
      ringing of the woodman's axe, the humble log cabin, the homespun dress,
      and all the many sober, hard realities of pioneer life, attest the
      youthfulness of the settlement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The city physician may be of timorous nature and weak and effeminate
      constitution: the &ldquo;swamp doctor,&rdquo; whose midnight ride is often saluted by
      the scream of the panther, must be of courageous nature, and in physical
      endurance as hardy as one of his own grand alluvial oaks, whose canopy of
      leaves is many a night his only shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The city physician may be of fastidious taste, and exquisiteness of
      feeling; the swamp doctor must have the unconcernedness of the
      dissecting-room, and be prepared to swallow his peck of dirt all at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      The city physician must be of polished manners and courtly language: the
      swamp doctor finds the only use he has for bows, is to escape some
      impending one that threatens him with Absalomic fate; the only necessity
      for courtly expression, to induce some bellicose &ldquo;squatter&rdquo; to pay his
      bill in something besides hot curses and cold lead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The city physician, fast anchored in the sublimity of scientific
      expression, requires a patient to &ldquo;inflate his lungs to their utmost
      capacity;&rdquo; the swamp doctor tells his to &ldquo;draw a long breath, or swell
      your d&mdash;dest:&rdquo; one calls an individual's physical peculiarities,
      &ldquo;idiosyncrasy;&rdquo; the other terms it &ldquo;a fellow's nater.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The city physician sends his prescriptions to the drug store, and gives
      himself no regard as to the purity of the medicine; each swamp doctor is
      his own <i>pharmacien</i>, and carries his drug store at the saddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The city physician rides in an easy carriage over well paved streets, and
      pays toll at the bridge; we mount a canoe, a pair of mud boots, sometimes
      a horse, and traverse, unmindful of exposure or danger, the sullen slough
      or angry river.
    </p>
    <p>
      The city physician wears broadcloth, and looking in his hat reads,
      &ldquo;Paris;&rdquo; we adorn the outer man with homespun, and gazing at our graceful
      castors remember the identical hollow tree in which we caught the coon
      that forms its fair outline and symmetrical proportions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The city physician goes to the opera or theatre, to relax, and while away
      a leisure evening. The swamp doctor resorts for the same purpose to a deer
      or bear hunt, a barbacue or bran dance, and generally ends by becoming
      perfectly hilarious, and evincing a determination to sit up in order that
      he can escort the young ladies home before breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The city physician, compelled to keep up appearances, deems a library of a
      hundred authors a moderate collection; the swamp doctor glories in the
      possession of &ldquo;Gunn's Domestic Medicine,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Mother's Guide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The city physician has a costly Parisian instrument for performing
      operations, and scorns to extract a tooth; the swamp doctor can rarely
      boast of a case of amputating instruments, and practises dentistry with a
      gum lancet and a pair of pullikens.
    </p>
    <p>
      The city physician, with intellect refined, but feelings vitiated by the
      corruptings and heart-hardenings of modern polished society, views with
      utter indifference or affected sympathy the dissolution of body and soul
      in his patients: but think you, we can see depart unmoved those with whom
      we have endured privations, have been knit like brothers together by our
      mutual dangers; with whom we have hunted, fished, and shared the crust and
      lowly couch; with whom we have rejoiced and sorrowed; think you we can see
      them go down to the grave with tearless eyes, with unmoved soul? If we
      can, then blot out that expression so accordant with common sentiment,
      &ldquo;God made the country, and man the town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The city physician sends the poor to the hospital, and eventually to the
      dissecting-room; we tend and furnish them gratuitously, and a proposal to
      dispose of them anatomically would, in all probability, put a knife into
      us.
    </p>
    <p>
      One, with a sickly frame, anticipates old age; the other, with a vigorous
      constitution, knows that exposure and privation will cut him off ere his
      meridian be reached.
    </p>
    <p>
      The city physician has soft hands, soft skin, and soft clothes: we have
      soft hearts but hard hands; we are rough in our phrases, but true in our
      natures; our words do not speak one language and our actions another; what
      we mean we say, what we say we mean; our characters, when not original,
      are impressed upon us by the people we practise among and associate with,
      for such is the character of the pioneers and pre-emptionists of the
      swamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      To sum up the whole, the city physician lives at the top of the pot, the
      swamp doctor scarcely at the rim of the skillet: one is a delicate carpet,
      which none but the nicest kid can press; the other is a cypress floor, in
      which the hobnails of every clown can stamp their shape: one is the breast
      of a chicken, the other is a muscle-shell full of cat-fish: one is
      quinine, the other Peruvian bark: and so on in the scale of proportions.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have contrasted the two through the busy, moving scenes of life; let me
      keep the curtain from descending awhile, till I draw the last and awful
      contrast.
    </p>

      Stand by the death-bed of the two, in that last and solemn hour, when
      disease has prescribed for the patient, and death, acting the <i>pharmacien</i>,
      is filling the R. In a close, suffocating room, horizontalized on a
      feather bed; if a bachelor, attended by a mercenary nurse; his departure
      eagerly desired by a host of expectant, envious competitors; with the
      noise of drays, the shouts of the busy multitude, and the many discordant
      cries of the city ringing through his frame, the soul of the city
      physician leaves its mortal tenement and wings its way to heaven through
      several floors and thicknesses of mortar and brick, whilst the sobs of his
      few true friends float on the air strangely mingled with &ldquo;Pies all hot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The last 'erald!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Five dollars reward, five dollars reward, for the
      lost child of a disconsolate family!&rdquo;

      The swamp doctor is gathered unto his fathers 'neath the greenwood tree,
      couched on the yielding grass, with the soft melody of birds, the
      melancholy cadence of the summer wind, the rippling of the stream, the
      sweet smell of flowers, and the blue sky above bending down as if to
      embrace him, to soothe his spirit, and give his parting soul a glance of
      that heaven which surely awaits him as a recompense for all the privations
      he has endured on earth; whilst the pressure on his palm of hard and manly
      hands, the tears of women attached to him like a brother by the past kind
      ministerings of his Godlike calling, the sobs of children, and the
      boisterous grief of the poor negroes, attest that not unregarded or
      unloved he hath dwelt on earth: a sunbeam steals through the leafy canopy
      and clothes his brow with a living halo, a sweet smile pervades his
      countenance, and amidst all that is beauteous in nature or commendable in
      man, the swamp doctor sinks in the blissful luxuries of death; no more to
      undergo privation and danger, disease or suffering. He hath given his last
      pill, had his last draught protested against; true to the instincts of his
      profession, he, no doubt, in the battling troop of the angels above, if
      feasible, will still continue to <i>charge</i>.

      MY EARLY LIFE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">U</span>pon what slender
      hinges the gate of a man's life turns, and what trifling things change the
      tenor of his being, and determine in a moment the direction of a lifetime!
      Who inhales his modicum of azote and oxygen, that cannot verify in his own
      person that we are the creatures of circumstances, and that there is a
      hidden divinity that shapes our ends, despite the endeavours of the
      pedagogue, man, to paddle them out of shape?
    </p>
    <p>
      Some writer of celebrity has averred, and satisfactorily proven to all of
      his way of thinking, by a chain of logical deductions, that the war of
      1812, the victory of New Orleans, the elevation of Jackson to the
      presidency, the annexation of Texas, General Taylor's not possessing the
      proportions of Hercules, and a sad accident that occurred to one of the
      best of families very recently, all was the inevitable effect of a quiet
      unobtrusive citizen in Maryland being charged some many years ago with hog
      stealing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Were I writing a library instead of a volume, I would take up, for the
      satisfaction of my readers, link by link, the chain of consequences, from
      the mighty to the insignificant; also, if time and eternity permitted,
      trace the genealogy of the memorable porker (upon whose forcible seizure
      all these events depended), back to the time when Adam was not required to
      show a tailor's bill unpaid, as a portent of gentility, or Eve thought it
      a wife's duty to henpeck her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I cannot do this, I will, by an analogous example, show that equally&mdash;to
      me at least&mdash;important consequences have been deduced from as
      unimportant and remote causes; and that the writing of this volume, my
      being a swamp doctor in 1848, and having been steamboat cook, cabin-boy,
      gentleman of leisure, plough-boy, cotton-picker, and almost a printer,
      depended when I was ten years old on a young lady wearing &ldquo;No. 2&rdquo; shoes,
      when common sense and the size of her foot whispered &ldquo;fives.&rdquo; And now to
      show the connexion between these remote facts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The death of my mother when I was very young breaking up our family
      circle, I became an inmate of the family of a married brother, whose wife,
      to an imperious temper, had, sadly for me, united the companionship of
      several younger brothers, whose associates I became when I entered her
      husband's door. Living in a free state, and his straitened circumstances
      permitting him but one hired servant, much of the family drudgery fell
      upon his wife, who up to my going there devolved a portion upon her
      brothers, but which all fell to my share as soon as I became domiciliated.
      I complained to my brother; but it was a younger brother arraigning a
      loved wife, and we all know how such a suit would be decided. Those only
      who have lived in similar circumstances can appreciate my situation;
      censured for errors and never praised for my industry, the scapegoat of
      the family and general errand-boy of the concern, waiting upon her
      brothers when I would fain have been at study or play, mine was anything
      but an enviable life. This condition of things continued until I had
      passed my tenth year, when, grown old by drudgery and wounded feelings, I
      determined to put into effect a long-cherished plan, to run away and seek
      my fortune wheresoever chance might lead or destiny determine.
    </p>
    <p>
      By day and by night for several years this thought had been upon me; it
      had grown with my growth, and acquired strength from each day's
      developement of fresh indignities, filling me with so much resolution,
      that the boy of ten had the mental strength of twenty to effect such a
      purpose. I occupied my few leisure hours in building airy castles of
      future fortune and distinction, and in marking out the preparatory road to
      make Providence my guide, and have the world before me, where to choose.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening, just at sunset, I was seated on the lintel of the
      street-door, nursing one of my nephews, and affecting to still his cries,
      the consequence of a spiteful pinch I had given him, to repay some
      indignity offered me by his mother, when my attention was attracted to a
      young lady, who, apparently in much suffering, was tottering along,
      endeavouring to support herself by her parasol, which she used as a cane.
      To look at me now with my single bed, buttonless shirts, premature wigdom,
      and haggard old-bachelor looks, you would scarcely think I am or was ever
      an admirer of the sex. But against appearances I have always been one; and
      boy as I was then, the sight of that young woman tottering painfully
      along, awoke all my sensibilities, and made the fountain of sympathy gush
      out as freely as a child swallowing lozenges. Overcoming my boyish
      diffidence, as she got opposite the door, I addressed her, &ldquo;Miss, will you
      not stop and rest? I will get you a chair, and you can stay in the porch,
      if you will not come in the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, my little man,&rdquo; she gasped out, and attempted to seat herself
      in the chair I had brought, but striking her foot against the step the
      pain was so great, that she shrieked out, and fell dead, as I thought, on
      the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frightened terribly to think I had brought dead folks home, I joined my
      yell to her scream, as a prolongation, which outcry brought my
      sister-in-law to the scene. The woman prevailing, she carried her in the
      house, and shutting the door to keep out curious eyes, which began to
      gather round, she set to restoring her uninvited guest, which she soon
      accomplished. As soon as she could speak, she gasped out, &ldquo;Take them off,
      they are killing me!&rdquo;&mdash;pointing to her feet. This, with difficulty,
      was effected, and their blood-stained condition showed how great must have
      been her torment. She announced herself as the daughter of a well-known
      merchant of the city, and begged permission to send me to her father's
      store, to request him to send a carriage for her. Assent being given, she
      gave me the necessary directions to find it, and off I started. It was
      near the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      On my way to the place, as I reached the river, I overtook a gentleman
      apparently laden down with baggage. On seeing me he said, &ldquo;My lad, I will
      give you a quarter if you will carry one of these bundles down to that
      steamboat,&rdquo; pointing to one that was ringing her last bell previous to
      starting to New Orleans. This was a world of money to me then, and I
      readily agreed. Increasing our pace, we reached just in time the steamer,
      between which and the place he had accosted me, I had determined, as the
      present opportunity was a good one, to put in execution my long-cherished
      plan, and run away from my home then. Its accomplishment was easy.
      Following my employer on board, I received my quarter; but instead of
      going on shore, I secreted myself on board, until the continued puff of
      the steamer and the merry chant of the firemen assured me we were fairly
      under way, that I was fast leaving my late home and becoming a fugitive
      upon the face of the waters, dependent upon my childish exertions for my
      daily bread, without money, save the solitary quarter, without a change of
      clothes; no friend to counsel me save the monitor within, a heart made
      aged and iron by contumely and youthful suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emerging from my concealment, I timidly sought the lower deck and sat me
      down upon the edge of the boat, and singling out some spark as it rose
      from the chimney, strove childishly to draw some augury of my future fate
      from its long continuance or speedy extinction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The city was fast fading in the distance. I watched its receding houses,
      for, while they lasted, I felt as if I was not altogether without a home.
      A turn of the river hid it from sight, and my tears fell fast, for I was
      also leaving the churchyard which held my mother, and I then had not grown
      old enough to read life's bitterest page, to separate dream from reality,
      and know we could meet no more on earth; for oftentimes in the quiet calm
      of sleep, in the lonely hours of night, I had seen her bending over my
      tear-wet pillow, and praying for me the same sweet prayer that she prayed
      for me when I was her sinless youngest born, and I thought in leaving her
      grave I should never see her more, for how, when she should rise again at
      night, would she be able to find me, rambler as I was?
    </p>
    <p>
      With this huge sorrow to dampen my joy at acquiring my liberty, chilled
      with the night air I was sinking into sleep in my dangerous seat, when the
      cook of the boat discovered me, and shaking me by the arm until I awoke,
      took me into the caboose, and giving me my supper, asked me, &ldquo;What I was
      doing there, where I would be certain to fall overboard if I went to
      sleep?&rdquo; I made up a fictitious tale, and finishing my story, asked him if
      he could assist me in getting some work on the boat to pay my passage,
      hinting I was not without experience in his department, in washing dishes,
      cleaning knives, &amp;c. This was just to his hand; promising me
      employment and protection, he gave me a place to sleep in, which, fatigued
      as I was, I did not suffer long to remain unoccupied.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morrow beheld me regularly installed as third cook or scullion, at
      eight dollars a month. This, to be sure, was climbing the world's ladder
      to fame and fortune at a snail's pace; but I was not proud, and willing to
      bide my time in hope of the better day a-coming. My leisure hours, which
      were not few, were employed in studying my books, of which I had a good
      supply, bought with money loaned me by my kind friend the cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      I improved rapidly in my profession, till one day my ambition was
      gratified by being allowed to make the corn bread for the first cabin
      table. This I executed in capital style, with the exception of forgetting
      in my elation to sift the meal, thereby kicking up considerable of a stir
      when it came to be eaten, and causing my receiving a hearty curse for my
      carelessness, and a threat of a rope's end, the exercise of which I
      crushed by seizing a butcher knife in very determined style, and the
      affair passed over.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remained on board until I had ascended as high as second cook, when I
      got disgusted with the kitchen and aspired to the cabin. I had heard of
      many cabin-boys becoming captain of their own vessels, but never of one
      cook,&mdash;except Captain Cook, and he became one from name, not by
      nature or profession. There being no vacancy on board, I received my wages
      and hired at V&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; as cabin boy on a small
      steamboat running as packet to a small town, situated on one of the
      tributaries of the Mississippi.
    </p>
    <p>
      On my first trip up I recollected that I had a brother living in the
      identical town to which the steamer was destined, who had been in the
      south for several years, and, when I last heard from him, was doing well
      in the world's ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought that as I would be landing every few days at his town, it would
      be only right that I should call and see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was merchandising on a large scale, I was informed by a gentleman on
      board, a planter in one of the middle counties of Mississippi, who, seeing
      me reading in the cabin after I had finished my labour of the day, opened
      a conversation with me, and, extracting my history by his mild
      persuasiveness, offered to take me home with him, and send me to school
      until my education for a profession was completed. But my independence
      spurned the idea of being indebted to such an extent to a stranger;
      perhaps I was too enamoured of my wild roving life. I refused his offer,
      thanking him gratefully for the kind interest he seemed to take in me. He
      made me promise, that if I changed my mind soon, I would write to him, and
      gave me his direction, which I soon lost, and his name has passed from my
      recollection.
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, I strolled up in town and inquired the
      way of a negro to Mr. Tensas' store. He pointed it out to me, and I
      entered. On inquiry for him, I found he was over at his dwelling-house,
      which I sought. It was a very pretty residence, I thought, for a bachelor;
      the walks were nicely gravelled, and shrubbery appropriately decorated the
      grounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knocked at the door boldly; after a short delay it was opened by quite a
      handsome young finely dressed lady. Thinking I was mistaken in the house,
      I inquired if my brother resided there? She replied, that he did and
      invited me to wait, as he would soon be home. Walking in, after a short
      interval my brother came. Not remarking me at first, he gave the young
      lady a hearty kiss, which she returned with interest. I concluded she must
      be his housekeeper. Perceiving me, he recognised me in a moment, and gave
      me an affectionate welcome, bidding me go and kiss my sister-in law,
      which, not waiting for me to do, she performed herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      My brother was very much shocked when he heard of my menial occupation,
      and used such arguments and persuasives to induce me to forsake my
      boat-cabin for his house, that I at length yielded.
    </p>
    <p>
      He intended sending me the next year to college, when the monetary crash
      came over the South, and the millionaire of to-day awoke the penniless
      bankrupt of the morrow. My brother strove manfully to resist the impending
      ruin, but fell like the rest, and I saw all my dreams of a collegiate
      education vanishing into thin smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why recount the scenes of the next five years? it is but the thrice-told
      tale, of a younger brother dependent upon an elder, himself dependent upon
      others for employment and a subsistence for his family; his circumstances
      would improve&mdash;I would be sent to school&mdash;fortune would again
      lower, and I, together with my sister-in-law, would perform the menial
      offices of the family.
    </p>
    <p>
      My sixteenth birthday was passed in the cotton-field, at the tail of a
      plough, in the midst of my fellow-labourers, between whom and myself but
      slight difference existed. I was discontented and unhappy. Something
      within kept asking me, as it had for years, if it was to become a toiler
      in the cotton-fields of the South, the companion of negroes, that I had
      stolen from my boyhood's home? was this the consummation of all my golden
      dreams?
    </p>
    <p>
      My prospects were gloomy enough to daunt a much older heart. Poverty shut
      out all hopes of a collegiate education and a profession. Reflection had
      disgusted me with a steamboat. I determined to learn a trade. My taste for
      reading naturally inclined me to one in which I could indulge it freely:
      it was a printer's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Satisfactory arrangements were soon made with a neighbouring printer and
      editor of a country newspaper. The day was fixed when he would certainly
      expect me; if I did not come by that time he was to conclude that I had
      altered my determination, and he would be free to procure another
      apprentice.
    </p>
    <p>
      A wedding was to come off in the family for which I worked, in a short
      time, and they persuaded me to delay my departure a week, and attend it. I
      remained, thinking my brother would inform the printer of the cause of my
      detention. The wedding passed off, and the next morning, bright and early,
      I bid adieu, without a pang of regret, to my late home, and started for my
      new master's, but who was destined never to become such; for on reaching
      the office I learnt that my brother had failed to inform him why I
      delayed, and he had procured another apprentice only the day before. So
      that wedding gave one subject less to the fraternity of typos, and made an
      indifferent swamp doctor of matter for a good printer.
    </p>
    <p>
      I returned home on foot, wallet on my back, and resumed my cotton-picking,
      feeling but little disappointed. I had shaken hands too often with
      poverty's gifts to let this additional grip give me much uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The season was nearly over, and the negroes were striving to get the
      cotton out by Christmas, when one night at the supper table&mdash;the only
      meal I partook of with the family&mdash;my brother inquired, &ldquo;How would
      you like to become a doctor, Madison?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thought he was jesting, and answered merely with a laugh. Become a
      doctor, a professional man, when I was too poor to go to a common school,
      was it not ludicrous?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am in earnest. Suppose a chance offered for you to become a student of
      medicine, would you accept it?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not the profession I would have selected had wealth given me a
      choice, but still it was a means of aquiring an education, a door through
      which I might possibly emerge to distinction, and I answered, &ldquo;Show me the
      way, and I will accept without hesitation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was not jesting. One of the first physicians in the state, taking a
      fancy to me, had offered to board me, clothe me, educate me in his
      profession, and become as a father to me, if I were willing to accept the
      kind offices at his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could scarcely realize the verity of what I had heard, yet 'twas true,
      and the ensuing new-year beheld me an inmate of the office of my
      benefactor.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is now in his grave. Stricken down a soldier of humanity at his post,
      ere the meridian of life was reached. Living, he was called the widow's
      and orphan's friend, and the tears of all attested, at his death, that the
      proud distinction was undenied. I am not much, yet what I am he made me;
      and when my heart fails to thrill in gratitude at the silent breathing of
      his name, may it be cold to the loudest tones of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behold me, then, a student of medicine, but yesterday a cotton-picker,
      illustrating within my own person, in the course of a few years, the
      versatility of American pursuits and character.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was scarcely sixteen, yet I was a student of medicine, and had been,
      almost a printer, a cotton-picker, plough-boy, gin-driver, gentleman of
      leisure, cabin-boy, cook, scullion, and runaway, all distinctly referable
      to the young lady before-mentioned wearing &ldquo;No. 2's,&rdquo; when her foot
      required &ldquo;fives.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      GETTING ACQUAINTED WITH THE MEDICINES.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span> ow, Mr. Tensas,&rdquo;
       said my kind preceptor, a few days after I had got regularly installed in
      the office, &ldquo;your first duty must be to get acquainted with the different
      medicines. This is a Dispensatory&mdash;as you read of a drug you will
      find the majority mentioned on the shelves, take it down and digest&rdquo;&mdash;here,
      unfortunately for the peace of mind and general welfare of a loafing
      Indian, who hung continually around the office, seeking what he might
      devour, or rather steal, the doctor was called away in a great hurry, and
      did not have time to finish his sentence, so &ldquo;take it down and digest,&rdquo;
       were the last words that remained in my mind. &ldquo;Take it down and digest.&rdquo;
       By the father of physic, thought I, this study of medicine is not the
      pleasant task I anticipated&mdash;rather arduous in the long run for the
      stomach, I should judge, to swallow and digest all the medicines, from
      Abracadabra to Zinzibar. Why, some of them are vomits, and I'd like to
      know how they are to be kept down long enough to be digested. Now, as for
      tamarinds, or liquorice, or white sugar, I might go them, but aloes, and
      rhubarb, and castor-oil, and running your finger down your throat, are
      rather disagreeable any way you can take them. I'm in for it, though; I
      suppose it's the way all doctors are made, and I have no claims to be
      exempted; and now for big book with the long name.
    </p>
    <p>
      I opened it upon a list of the metals. Leading them in the order that
      alphabetical arrangement entitled it to, was, &ldquo;Arsenic: deadly poison.
      Best preparation, Fowler's Solution. Symptoms from an overdose, burning in
      the stomach, great thirst, excessive vomiting,&rdquo; &amp;c., &amp;c. With eyes
      distended to their utmost capacity, I read the dread' enumeration of its
      properties. What! take this infernal medicament down, digest it, and run
      the chances of its not being an overdose? Can't think of it a moment. I'll
      go back to my plough first; but then the doctor knew all the dangers when
      he gave his directions, and he was so precise and particular, there cannot
      be any mistake. I'll take a look at it anyhow, and I hunted it up. As the
      Dispensatory preferred Fowler's Solution, I selected that. Expecting to
      find but a small quantity, I was somewhat surprised when I discovered it
      in a four-gallon bottle, nearly full. I took out the stopper, and applied
      it cautiously to my nose. Had it not been for the label, bearing, in
      addition to the name, the fearful word &ldquo;Poison,&rdquo; and the ominous skull and
      cross-bones, I would have sworn it was good old Bourbon whiskey. Old
      Tubba, the Indian, was sitting in the office door, watching my proceedings
      with a great deal of interest. Catching the spirituous odour of the
      arsenical solution, he rose up and approached me eagerly, saying, &ldquo;Ugh;
      Injun want whiskey; give Tubba whiskey; bring wild duck, so many,&rdquo; holding
      up two of his fingers. The temptation was strong, I must confess. The
      medicines had to be tested, and I felt very much disinclined to depart
      this life just then, when the pin feathers of science had just commenced
      displacing the soft down of duck-lingdom; but this Indian, he is of no
      earthly account or use to any one; no one would miss him, even were he to
      take an overdose; science often has demanded sacrifices, and he would be a
      willing one; but&mdash;it may kill him; I can't do it; to kill a man
      before I get my diploma will be murder; a jury might not so pronounce it,
      but conscience would; I can't swallow it, and Tubba must not. These were
      the thoughts that flashed through my mind before I replied to the Indian's
      request. &ldquo;Indian can't have whiskey. Tubba drink whiskey&mdash;Tubba do
      so.&rdquo; Here I endeavoured to go through the pantomime of dying, as I was not
      master of sufficient Choctaw to explain myself. I lifted a glass to my
      mouth and pretended to empty it, then gave a short yell, clapping my hands
      over my stomach, staggering, jerking my hands and feet about, as I fell on
      the floor, repeating the yells, then turned on my face and lay still as
      though I was dead. But to my chagrin, all this did not seem to affect the
      Indian with that horror that I intended, but on the contrary, he grunted
      out a series of ughs, expressive of his satisfaction, saying, &ldquo;Ugh; Tubba
      want get drunk too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dinner hour arriving, I dismissed old Tubba, and arranging my toilet,
      walked up to the dwelling-house, near half a mile distant, where I was
      detained several hours by the presence of company, to whom I was forced to
      do the honours, the doctor not having returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length I got released, and returned to the office, resolving to suspend
      my studies until I could have a talk with my preceptor; for, even on my
      ignorant mind, the shadow of a doubt was falling as to whether there might
      not be some mistake in my understanding of his language.
    </p>
    <p>
      Entering the office, my eyes involuntarily sought the Solution of Arsenic.
      Father of purges and pukes, it was gone! &ldquo;Tubba, you're a gone case. I
      ought to have hidden it. I might have known he would steal it after
      smelling the whiskey; poor fellow! it's no use to try and find him, he's
      struck a straight line for the swamp; poor fellow! it's all my fault.&rdquo;
       Thus upbraiding myself for my carelessness, I walked back into my bedroom.
      And my astonishment may be imagined, when I discovered the filthy Indian
      tucked in nicely between my clean sheets.
    </p>
    <p>
      To all appearances he was in a desperate condition, the fatal bottle lying
      hugged closely in his embrace, nearly empty. He must be suffering awfully,
      thought I, when humanity had triumphed over the indignation I felt at the
      liberties he had taken, but Indian-like, he bears it without a groan. Well
      has his race been called &ldquo;the stoics of the wood, the men without a tear.&rdquo;
       But I must not let him die without an effort to save him. I don't know
      what to do myself, so I'll call in Dr. B., and away I posted; but Dr. B.
      was absent; so was Dr. L.; and in fact every physician of the town. Each
      office, however, contained one or more students; and as half a loaf is
      better than no bread, I speedily informed them of the condition of
      affairs, and quickly, like a flock of young vultures, we were thronging
      around the poisoned Indian, to what we would soon have rendered the
      harvest of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stomach pump eo instanti!&rdquo; said one; &ldquo;Sulphas Zinci cum Decoction
      Tabacum!&rdquo; said another; &ldquo;Venesection!&rdquo; suggested a third. &ldquo;Puke of
      Lobelia!&rdquo; suggested a young disciple of Thompson, who self-invited had
      joined the conclave, &ldquo;Lobelia. Number six, pepper tea, yaller powders, I
      say!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turn him out! Turn him out! What right has young Roots in a mineral
      consultation? Turn him out!&rdquo;&mdash;and heels over head, out of the room,
      through the middle door, and down the office steps, went &ldquo;young Roots,&rdquo;
       impelled by the whole body of the enraged &ldquo;regulars&rdquo;&mdash;save myself,
      who, determined amidst the array of medical lore not to appear ignorant,
      wisely held my tongue and rubbed the patient's feet with a greased rag.
      Again arose the jargon of voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sulphas Zinci&mdash;Stomach, Arteri, pump, otomy-must&mdash;legs&mdash;hot-toddy&mdash;to
      bleed him&mdash;lectricity&mdash;hot blister&mdash;flat-irons&mdash;open
      his&mdash;windpipe but still I said never a word, but rubbed his feet,
      wondering whether I would ever acquire as much knowledge as my fellow
      students showed the possession of. By the by, I was the only one that was
      doing anything for the patient, the others being too busy discussing the
      case to attend to the administration of any one of the remedies proposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say stimulate, the system is sinking,&rdquo; screamed a tall, stout-looking
      student, as the Indian slid down towards the foot of the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bleeding is manifestly and clearly indicated,&rdquo; retorted a bitter rival in
      love as well as medicine, &ldquo;his muscular action is too excessive,&rdquo; as Tubba
      made an ineffectual effort to throw his body up to the top of the mosquito
      bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bleeding would be as good as murder,&rdquo; said Number 1.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better cut his throat than stimulate him,&rdquo; said Number 2.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fudge!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fellow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fool!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Liar!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yim! Yim! and stomach-pump and brandy bottle flashed like meteors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fight! fight! form a ring! fair play!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're holding my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You lie! You rascal!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vim! Vim! from a new brace of combatants.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's gouging my brother! I must help! foul play!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let go my hair!&rdquo; Vim! Vim! and a triplet went at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stopped rubbing, and looked on with amazement. &ldquo;Gentlemen, this is
      unprofessional! 'tis undignified! 'tis disgraceful! stop, I command you!&rdquo;
       I yelled, but no one regarded me; some one struck me, and away I pitched
      into the whole lot promiscuously, having no partner, the patient dying on
      the bed whilst we were studying out his case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fight! fight!&rdquo; I heard yelled in the street, as I had finished giving a
      lick all round, and could hardly keep pitching into the mirror to whip my
      reflection, I wanted a fight so bad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fight! fight! in D-5s back office!&rdquo; and here came the whole town to see
      the fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I command the peace!&rdquo; yelled Dick Locks; &ldquo;I'm the mayor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I'm the hoss for you!&rdquo; screamed I, doubling him up with a lick in the
      stomach, which he replied to by laying me on my back, feeling very faint,
      in the opposite corner of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I command the peace!&rdquo; continued Dick, flinging one of the combatants out
      of the window, another out of the door, and so on alternately, until the
      peace was preserved by nearly breaking its infringers to pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What in the devil, Mr. Tensas, does this mean?&rdquo; said my preceptor, who at
      that moment came in; &ldquo;what does all this fighting, and that drunken Indian
      lying in your bed, mean? have you all been drunk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has poisoned himself, sir, in my absence, with the solution of
      arsenic, which he took for whiskey; and as all the doctors were out of
      town, I called in the students, and they got to fighting over him whilst
      consulting;&rdquo; I replied, very indignantly, enraged at the insinuation that
      we had been drinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poisoned with solution of arsenic, ha! ha! oh! lord! ha!&rdquo; and my
      preceptor, throwing his burly form on the floor, rolled over and over,
      making the office ring with his laughter&mdash;&ldquo;poisoned, ha! ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get out of this, you drunken rascal!&rdquo; said he to the dying patient,
      applying his horse-whip to him vigorously. It acted like a charm: giving a
      loud yell of defiance, the old Choctaw sprang into the middle of the
      floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whoop! whiskey lour! Injun big man, drunk heap. Whoop! Tubba big Injun
      heap!&rdquo; making tracks for the door, and thence to the swamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth must out. The boys had got into the habit of making too free
      with my preceptor's whiskey; and to keep off all but the knowing one, he
      had labelled it, &ldquo;Solution of Arsenic.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      A TIGHT RACE CONSIDERIN'.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>uring my medical
      studies, passed in a small village in Mississippi, I became acquainted
      with a family named Hibbs (a <i>nom de plume</i> of course), residing a
      few miles in the country. The family consisted of Mr. and Mrs. Hibbs and
      son. They were plain, unlettered people, honest in intent and deed, but
      overflowing with that which amply made up for all their deficiencies of
      education, namely, warm-hearted hospitality, the distinguishing trait of
      southern character. They were originally from Virginia, from whence they
      had emigrated in quest of a clime more genial, and a soil more productive
      than that in which their fathers toiled. Their search had been rewarded,
      their expectations realized, and now, in their old age, though not wealthy
      in the &ldquo;Astorian&rdquo; sense, still they had sufficient to keep the &ldquo;wolf from
      the door,&rdquo; and drop something more substantial than condolence and tears
      in the hat that poverty hands round for the kind offerings of humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man was like the generality of old planters, men whose ambition is
      embraced by the family or social circle, and whose thoughts turn more on
      the relative value of &ldquo;Sea Island&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mastodon,&rdquo; and the improvement of
      their plantations, than the &ldquo;glorious victories of Whig-gery in Kentucky,&rdquo;
       or the &ldquo;triumphs of democracy in Arkansas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old lady was a shrewd, active dame, kind-hearted and long-tongued,
      benevolent and impartial, making her coffee as strong for the poor
      pedestrian, with his all upon his back, as the broadcloth sojourner, with
      his &ldquo;up-country pacer.&rdquo; She was a member of the church, as well as the
      daughter of a man who had once owned a race-horse: and these circumstances
      gave her an indisputable right, she thought, to &ldquo;let on all she knew,&rdquo;
       when religion or horse-flesh was the theme. At one moment she would be
      heard discussing whether the new &ldquo;circus rider,&rdquo; (as she always called
      him,) was as affecting in Timothy as the old one was pathetic in Paul, and
      anon (not anonymous, for the old lady did everything above board, except
      rubbing her corns at supper), protecting dad's horse from the invidious
      comparisons of some visiter, who, having heard, perhaps, that such horses
      as Fashion and Boston existed, thought himself qualified to doubt the old
      lady's assertion that her father's horse &ldquo;Shumach&rdquo; had run a mile on one
      particular occasion. &ldquo;Don't tell <i>me</i>,&rdquo; was her never failing reply
      to their doubts, &ldquo;Don't tell <i>me</i> 'bout Fashun or Bosting, or any
      other beating 'Shumach' a fair race, for the thing was unfesible; did'nt
      he run a mile a minute by Squire Dim's watch, which always stopt 'zactly
      at twelve, and did'nt he start a minute afore, and git out, jes as the
      long hand war givin' its last quiver on ketchin' the short leg of the
      watch? And didn't he beat everything in Virginny 'cept once? Dad and the
      folks said he'd beat then, if young Mr. Spotswood hadn't give 'old Swaga,'
      Shumach's rider, some of that 'Croton water,' (that them Yorkers is makin'
      sich a fuss over as bein' so good, when gracious knows, nothin' but what
      the doctors call interconception could git me to take a dose) and jis
      'fore the race Swage or Shumach, I don't 'stinctly 'member which, but one
      of them had to 'let down,' and so dad's hoss got beat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The son I will describe in few words. Imbibing his parents' contempt for
      letters, he was very illiterate, and as he had not enjoyed the equivalent
      of travel, was extremely ignorant on all matters not relating to hunting
      or plantation duties. He was a stout, active fellow, with a merry
      twinkling of the eye, indicative of humour, and partiality for practical
      joking. We had become very intimate, he instructing me in &ldquo;forest lore,&rdquo;
       and I, in return, giving amusing stories, or, what was as much to his
      liking, occasional introductions to my hunting-flask.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that I have introduced the &ldquo;Dramatis Personæ,&rdquo; I will proceed with my
      story. By way of relaxation, and to relieve the tedium incident more or
      less to a student's life, I would take my gun, walk out to old Hibbs's,
      spend a day or two, and return refreshed to my books.
    </p>
    <p>
      One fine afternoon I started upon such an excursion, and as I had upon a
      previous occasion missed killing a fine buck, owing to my having nothing
      but squirrel shot, I determined to go this time for the &ldquo;antlered
      monarch,&rdquo; by loading one barrel with fifteen &ldquo;blue whistlers,&rdquo; reserving
      the other for small game.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the near end of the plantation was a fine spring, and adjacent, a small
      cave, the entrance artfully or naturally concealed, save to one acquainted
      with its locality. The cave was nothing but one of those subterraneous
      washes so common in the west and south, and called &ldquo;sink holes.&rdquo; It was
      known only to young H. and myself, and we, for peculiar reasons, kept
      secret, having put it in requisition as the depository of a jug of &ldquo;old
      Bourbon,&rdquo; which we favoured, and as the old folks abominated drinking, we
      had found convenient to keep there, whither we would repair to get our
      drinks, and return to the house to hear them descant on the evils of
      drinking, and &ldquo;vow no 'drap,' 'cept in doctor's truck, should ever come on
      their plantation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Feeling very thirsty, I took my way by the spring that evening. As I
      descended the hill o'ertopping it, I beheld the hind parts of a bear
      slowly being drawn into the cave. My heart bounded at the idea of killing
      a bear, and my plans were formed in a second. I had no dogs&mdash;the
      house was distant&mdash;and the bear becoming &ldquo;small by degrees, and
      beautifully less.&rdquo; Every hunter knows, if you shoot a squirrel in the head
      when it's sticking out of a hole, ten to one he'll jump out; and I
      reasoned that if this were true regarding squirrels, might not the
      operation of the same principle extract a bear, applying it low down in
      the back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quick as thought I levelled my gun and fired, intending to give him the
      buckshot when his body appeared; but what was my surprise and horror,
      when, instead of a bear rolling out, the parts were jerked nervously in,
      and the well-known voice of young H. reached my ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Murder! Hingins! h&mdash;ll and kuckle-burs! Oh! Lordy' 'nuff!&mdash;'nuff!&mdash;take
      him off! Jis let me off this wunst, dad, and I'll never run mam's colt
      again! Oh! Lordy! Lordy! <i>all my brains blowed, clean out</i>! Snakes!
      snakes!&rdquo; yelled he, in a shriller tone, if possible, &ldquo;H&mdash;ll on the
      outside and snakes in the sink-hole! I'll die a Christian, anyhow, and if
      I die before I wake,&rdquo; and out scrambled poor H., pursued by a large
      black-snake.
    </p>
    <p>
      If my life had depended on it, I could not have restrained my laughter.
      Down fell the gun, and down dropped I shrieking convulsively. The hill was
      steep, and over and over I went, until my head striking against a stump at
      the bottom, stopped me, half senseless. On recovering somewhat from the
      stunning blow, I found Hibbs upon me, taking satisfaction from me for
      having blowed out his brains. A contest ensued, and H. finally
      relinquished his hold, but I saw from the knitting of his brows, that the
      bear-storm, instead of being over, was just brewing. &ldquo;Mr. Tensas,&rdquo; he said
      with awful dignity, &ldquo;I'm sorry I put into you 'fore you cum to, but you're
      at yourself now, and as you've tuck a shot at me, it's no more than far I
      should have a chance 'fore the hunt's up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was with the greatest difficulty I could get H. to bear with me until I
      explained the mistake; but as soon as he learned it, he broke out in a
      huge laugh. &ldquo;Oh, Dod busted! that's 'nuff; you has my pardon. I ought to
      know'd you didn't 'tend it; 'sides, you jis scraped the skin. I war wus
      skeered than hurt, and if you'll go to the house and beg me off from the
      old folks, I'll never let on you cuddent tell copperas breeches from
      bar-skin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Promising that I would use my influence, I proposed taking a drink, and
      that he should tell me how he had incurred his parent's anger. He
      assented, and after we had inspected the cave, and seen that it held no
      other serpent than the one we craved, we entered its cool recess, and H.
      commenced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, Doc, I'd heered so much from mam 'bout her dad's Shumach and his
      nigger Swage, and the mile a minute, and the Croton water what was gin
      him, and how she bleved that if it warn't for bettin', and the cussin' and
      fightin', running race-hosses warn't the sin folks said it war; and if
      they war anything to make her 'gret gettin' religion and jinin' the
      church, it war cos she couldn't 'tend races, and have a race-colt of her
      own to comfort her 'clinin' years, sich as her daddy had afore her, till
      she got me; so I couldn't rest for wantin' to see a hoss-race, and go
      shares, p'raps, in the colt she war wishin' for. And then I'd think what
      sort of a hoss I'd want him to be&mdash;a quarter nag, a mile critter, or
      a hoss wot could run (fur all mam says it can't be did) a whole four mile
      at a stretch. Sometimes I think I'd rather own a quarter nag, for the
      suspense wouldn't long be hung, and then we could run up the road to old
      Nick Bamer's cow-pen, and Sally is almost allers out thar in the cool of
      the evenin'; and in course we wouldn't be so cruel as to run the poor
      critter in the heat of the day. But then agin, I'd think I'd rather have a
      miler,&mdash;for the 'citement would be greater, and we could run down the
      road to old Wither's orchard, an' his gal Miry is frightfully fond of
      sunnin' herself thar, when she 'spects me 'long, and she'd hear of the
      race, certain; but then thar war the four miler for my thinkin', and I'd
      knew'd in such case the 'citement would be greatest of all, and you know,
      too, from dad's stable to the grocery is jist four miles, an' in case of
      any 'spute, all hands would be willin' to run over, even if it had to be
      tried a dozen times. So I never could 'cide on which sort of a colt to
      wish for. It was fust one, then t'others, till I was nearly 'stracted, and
      when mam, makin' me religious, told me one night to say grace, I jes shut
      my eyes, looked pious, and yelled out, 'D&mdash;&mdash;n it, go!' and in
      'bout five minutes arter, came near kickin' dad's stumak off, under the
      table, thinkin' I war spurrin' my critter in a tight place.. So I found
      the best way was to get the hoss fust, and then 'termine whether it should
      be Sally Bamers, and the cow-pen; Miry Withers, and the peach orchard; or
      Spillman's grocery, with the bald face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've seed my black colt, that one that dad's father gin me in his will
      when he died, and I 'spect the reason he wrote that will war, that he
      might have wun then, for it's more then he had when he was alive, for
      granma war a monstrus overbearin' woman. The colt would cum up in my mind,
      every time I'd think whar I was to git a hoss. 'Git out!' said I at fust&mdash;he
      never could run, and 'sides if he could, mam rides him now, an he's too
      old for anything, 'cept totin her and bein' called mine; for you see,
      though he war named Colt, yet for the old lady to call him old, would bin
      like the bar 'fecting contempt for the rabbit, on account of the shortness
      of his tail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, thought I, it does look sorter unpromisin', but its colt or none;
      so I 'termined to put him in trainin' the fust chance. Last Saturday, who
      should cum ridin' up but the new cirkut preacher, a long-legged, weakly,
      sickly,
      never-contented-onless-the-best-on-the-plantation-war-cooked-fur-him sort
      of a man; but I didn't look at him twice, his hoss was the critter that
      took my eye; for the minute I looked at him, I knew him to be the same
      hoss as Sam Spooner used to win all his splurgin' dimes with, the folks
      said, and wot he used to ride past our house so fine on. The hoss war a
      heap the wuss for age and change of masters; for preachers, though they're
      mity 'ticular 'bout thar own comfort, seldom tends to thar hosses, for one
      is privit property and 'tother generally borried. I seed from the way the
      preacher rid, that he didn't know the animal he war straddlin'; but I did,
      and I 'termined I wouldn't lose sich a chance of trainin' Colt by the side
      of a hoss wot had run real races. So that night, arter prayers and the
      folks was abed, I and Nigger Bill tuck the hosses and carried them down to
      the pastur'. It war a forty-aker lot, and consequently jist a quarter
      across&mdash;for I thought it best to promote Colt, by degrees, to a
      four-miler. When we got thar, the preacher's hoss showed he war willin';
      but Colt, dang him! commenced nibblin' a fodder-stack over the fence. I
      nearly cried for vexment, but an idea struck me; I hitched the critter,
      and told Bill to get on Colt and stick tight wen I giv' the word. Bill got
      reddy, and unbeknownst to him I pulled up a bunch of nettles, and, as I
      clapped them under Colt's tail, yelled, 'Go!' Down shut his graceful like
      a steel-trap, and away he shot so quick an' fast that he jumpt clean out
      from under Bill, and got nearly to the end of the quarter 'fore the nigger
      toch the ground: he lit on his head, and in course warn't hurt&mdash;so we
      cotched Colt, an' I mounted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The next time I said 'go' he showed that age hadn't spiled his legs or
      memory. Bill 'an me 'greed we could run him now, so Bill mounted Preacher
      and we got ready. Thar war a narrer part of the track 'tween two oaks, but
      as it war near the end of the quarter, I 'spected to pass Preacher 'fore
      we got thar, so I warn't afraid of barkin' my shins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We tuck a fair start, and off we went like a peeled injun, an' I soon
      'scovered that it warn't such an easy matter to pass Preacher, though Colt
      dun delightful; we got nigh the trees, and Preacher warn't past yet, an' I
      'gan to get skeered, for it warn't more than wide enuf for a horse and a
      half; so I hollered to Bill to hold up, but the imperdent nigger turned
      his ugly pictur, and said, 'he'd be cussed if he warn't goin' to play his
      han' out.' I gin him to understand he'd better fix for a foot-race when we
      stopt, and tried to hold up Colt, but he wouldn't stop. We reached the
      oaks, Colt tried to pass Preacher, Preacher tried to pass Colt, and
      cowollop, crosh, cochunk! we all cum down like 'simmons arter frost. Colt
      got up and won the race; Preacher tried hard to rise, but one hind leg had
      got threw the stirrup, an' tother in the head stall, an' he had to lay
      still, doubled up like a long nigger in a short bed. I lit on my feet, but
      Nigger Bill war gone entire. I looked up in the fork of one of the oaks,
      and thar he war sittin', lookin' very composed on surroundin' nature. I
      couldn't git him down till I promised not to hurt him for disobeyin'
      orders, when he slid down. We'd 'nuff racin' for that night', so we put up
      the hosses and went to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next morning the folks got ready for church, when it was diskivered that
      the hosses had got out. I an' Bill started off to look for them; we found
      them cleer off in the field, tryin' to git in the pastur' to run the last
      night's race over, old Blaze, the reverlushunary mule, bein' along to act
      as judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the time we got to the house it war nigh on to meet-in' hour; and dad
      had started to the preachin', to tell the folks to sing on, as preacher
      and mam would be 'long bimeby. As the passun war in a hurry, and had been
      complainin' that his creetur war dull, I 'suaded him to put on uncle Jim's
      spurs what he fotch from Mexico. I saddled the passun's hoss, takin'
      'ticular pains to let the saddle-blanket come down low in the flank. By
      the time these fixins war threw, mam war 'head nigh on to a quarter. 'We
      must ride on, passun,' I said, 'or the folks 'll think we is lost.' So I
      whipt up the mule I rid, the passun chirrupt and chuct to make his crittur
      gallop, but the animal didn't mind him a pic. I 'gan to snicker, an' the
      passun 'gan to git vext; sudden he thought of his spurs, so he ris up, an'
      drove them <i>vim</i> in his hoss's flanx, till they went through his
      saddle-blanket, and like to bored his nag to the holler. By gosh! but it
      war a quickener&mdash;the hoss kickt till the passun had to hug him round
      the neck to keep from pitchin' him over his head. He next jumpt up 'bout
      as high as a rail fence, passun holdin' on and tryin' to git his spurs&mdash;but
      they war lockt&mdash;his breeches split plum across with the strain, and
      the piece of wearin' truck wot's next the skin made a monstrous putty flag
      as the old hoss, like drunkards to a bar-bacue, streakt it up the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mam war ridin' slowly along, thinkin' how sorry she was, cos Chary Dolin,
      who always led her off, had sich a bad cold, an' wouldn't be able to 'sist
      her singin' to-day. She war practisin' the hymns, and had got as far as
      whar it says, 'I have a race to run,' when the passun huv in sight, an' in
      'bout the dodgin' of a diedapper, she found thar war truth in the words,
      for the colt, hearin' the hoss cumin' up behind, began to show symptoms of
      runnin'; but when he heard the passun holler 'wo! wo!' to his hoss, he
      thought it war me shoutin' 'go!' and sure 'nuff off they started jis as
      the passun got up even; so it war a fair race. Whoop! git out, but it war
      egsitin'&mdash;the dust flew, and the rail-fence appeered strate as a
      rifle. Thar war the passun, his legs fast to the critter's flanx, arms
      lockt round his neck, face as pale as a rabbit's belly, and the white flag
      streemin' far behind&mdash;and thar war Mam, fust on one side, then on
      t'other, her new caliker swelled up round her like a bear with the dropsy,
      the old lady so much surprized she cuddent ride steddy, an' tryin' to stop
      her colt, but he war too well trained to stop while he heard 'go!' Mam got
      'sited at last, and her eyes to glimmer like she seen her daddy's ghost
      axin.' 'if he ever trained up a child or a race-hoss to be 'fraid of a
      small brush on a Sunday,' she commenced ridin' beautiful; she braced
      herself up in the saddle, and began to make calkerlations how she war to
      win the race, for it war nose and nose, and she saw the passun spurrut'
      his critter every jump. She tuk off her shoe, and the way a number ten
      go-to-meetin' brogan commenced givin' a hoss particular Moses, were a
      caution to hoss-flesh&mdash;but still it kept nose and nose.

      &ldquo;She found she war carryin' too much weight for Colt, so she 'gan to throw
      off plunder, till nothin' was left but her saddle and close, and the spurs
      kept tellin' still. The old woman commenced strippin' to lighten, till it
      wouldn't bin the clean thing for her to have taken off one dud more; an'
      then when she found it war no use while the spurs lasted, she got
      cantankerous. 'Passun,' said she, 'I'll be cust if it's fair or
      gentlemanly for you, a preacher of the gospel, to take advantage of an old
      woman this way, usin' spurs when you know <i>she</i> can't wear 'em&mdash;'taint
      Christian-like nuther,' and she burst into cryin'. 'Wo! Miss Hibbs! Wo!
      Stop! Madam! Wo! Your son!'&mdash;he attempted to say, when the old woman
      tuck him on the back of the head, and fillin' his mouth with right smart
      of a saddle-horn, and stop-pin' the talk, as far as his share went for the
      present.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By this time they'd got nigh on to the meetin'-house, and the folks were
      harkin' away on 'Old Hundred,' and wonderin' what could have become of the
      passun and mam Hibbs. One sister in a long beard axt another brethren in
      church, if she'd heered anything 'bout that New York preecher runnin' way
      with a woman old enough to be his muther. The brethrens gin a long sigh
      an' groaned 'it ain't possible! marciful heavens! you don't 'spicion?' wen
      the sound of the hosses comin', roused them up like a touch of the agur,
      an' broke off their sarpent-talk. Dad run out to see what was to pay, but
      when he seed the hosses so close together, the passun spurrin', and mam
      ridin' like close war skase whar she cum, he knew her fix in a second, and
      'tarmined to help her; so clinchin' a sap-lin', he hid 'hind a stump 'bout
      ten steps off, and held on for the hosses. On they went in beautiful
      style, the passun's spurs tellin' terrible, and mam's shoe operatin' 'no
      small pile of punkins,'&mdash;passun stretched out the length of two
      hosses, while mam sot as stiff and strate as a bull yearling in his fust
      fight, hittin' her nag, fust on one side, next on t'other, and the third
      for the passun, who had chawed the horn till little of the saddle, and
      less of his teeth war left, and his voice sounded as holler as a
      jackass-nicker in an old saw-mill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The hosses war nose and nose, jam up together so close that mam's last
      kiverin' and passun's flag had got lockt, an' 'tween bleached domestic and
      striped linsey made a beautiful banner for the pious racers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On they went like a small arthquake, an' it seemed like it war goin' to
      be a draun race; but dad, when they got to him, let down with all his
      might on colt, searin' him so bad that he jumpt clean ahead of passun,
      beatin' him by a neck, buttin' his own head agin the meetin'-house, an'
      pitchin' mam, like a lam for the 'sacryfise, plum through the winder
      'mongst the mourners, leavin' her only garment flutterin' on a nail in
      the'sash. The men shot their eyes and scrambled outen the house, an' the
      women gin mam so much of their close that they like to put themselves in
      the same fix.

    <h2>
      TAKING GOOD ADVICE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span> Poor fellow! if
      he had only listened to me! but he wouldn't take good advice,&rdquo; is the
      trite exclamation of the worldling when he hears that some friend has cut
      his throat, impelled by despair, or has become bankrupt, or employed a
      famous physician, or is about to get married, or has applied for a
      divorce, or paid his honest debts, or committed any deprecated act, or
      become the victim of what the world calls misfortune; &ldquo;poor fellow, but he
      wouldn't take good advice.&rdquo; Take good advice! yes, if I had obeyed what is
      called good advice, I would be now in my grave; as it is, I am still on a
      tailor's books, the best evidence of a man's being alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I was a boy my friends were continually chiding me for my half bent
      position in sitting or walking, and since I have become a man the cry is
      still the same, &ldquo;Why don't you walk straight, Madison? hold up your head.&rdquo;
       Had I obeyed them, a tree-top that fell upon me whilst visiting a patient
      lately, crushing my shoulder and bruising my back, would have fallen
      directly upon my head, and shown, in all probability, the emptiness of
      earthly things. This is one instance showing that good advice is not
      always best to be taken; but I have another, illustrating my position
      still more strongly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst a medical student, I was travelling on one of the proverbially fine
      and accommodating steamers that ply between Vicksburg and New Orleans.
      Before my departure, the anxious affection of a female friend made her
      exact a promise from me not to play cards; but the peculiarity of the
      required pledge gave me an opportunity of fulfilling it to the letter, but
      breaking it as to the spirit. &ldquo;You've promised me, Madison, not to play
      cards whilst you're on <i>earth</i>: see that you keep it.&rdquo; I assured her
      I would do so, as it applied only to shore, and when the boat was on a
      sand-bar. It was more her friendly solicitude than any real necessity in
      my habits, that made her require the promise, as I never played except on
      steamboats, and then only at night, when the beautiful scenery that skirts
      the river cannot be seen or admired.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a boisterous night above in the heavens, making the air too cool
      for southern dress or nerves, so the cabin and social hall were densely
      crowded, not a small proportion engaged in the mysteries of that science
      which requires four knaves to play or practise it. I had not yet sat down,
      but showed strong premonitory symptoms of being about to do so, when my
      arm was gently taken by an old friend, who requested me to walk with him
      into our state-room. &ldquo;Madison,&rdquo; said the old gentleman, &ldquo;I want to give
      you some good advice. I see you are about to play cards for money; you are
      a young man, and consequently have but little knowledge of its pernicious
      effects. I speak from experience; and apart from the criminality of
      gambling, I assure you, you will have but little chance of winning in the
      crowd you intend playing with: in fact, you are certain to lose. Now
      promise me you won't play, and I shall go to bed with the satisfaction
      that I have saved you from harm.&rdquo; The charm was laid too skilfully upon
      me; I would not promise, for what was I to do in the long nights of
      present and future travel? so my old friend gave me up in despair, and
      retired to rest, whilst I sought the card-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young and inexperienced as I was, an unusual strain of good luck attended
      me; and when the game broke up at daylight, I was considerably ahead of
      the hounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      I retired to my state-room to regain my lost sleep, and soon was oblivious
      of everything. How long I slept I do not know: my dreams ran upon the past
      game; and just as I held &ldquo;four aces,&rdquo; and had seen my opponent's two
      hundred and went him four hundred dollars better, I was aroused from my
      slumbers by the confused cries of &ldquo;Fire! Back her! Stop her! She'll blow
      up when she strikes!&rdquo; and a thousand-and-one undistinguishable sounds, but
      all indicative of intense excitement and alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stopping for nothing, I made one spring from my berth into the middle of
      the cabin, alighting on the deserted breakfast-table, amidst the crash of
      broken crockery, three jumps more were taken, which landed me up on the
      hurricane-deck, where I found nearly all the passengers, male and female,
      assembled in a fearful state of alarm, preventing by their outcry the
      necessary orders, for the preservation of the boat, from being heard. I
      took in the whole scene at a glance. I forgot to mention, when I retired
      to rest, the wind was blowing to such a degree that every gust threatened
      to overset the boat. The captain, who was a prudent, sensible man, had
      tied his boat to the shore, waiting for the storm to subside. After the
      lapse of a few hours, a calm having ensued, he cast loose, intending to
      proceed on his way; but scarcely had he done so, when the wind, suddenly
      increasing, caught the boat, and, in despite of six boilers and the helm
      hard down, was carrying her directly across the Mississippi, towards the
      opposite shore, where a formidable array of old &ldquo;poke-stalks&rdquo; and low,
      bluff banks were eagerly awaiting to impale us upon the one hand, or knock
      us into a cocked hat upon the other. At this time I arrived upon the scene&mdash;the
      boat was nearly at the shore, the waters boiling beneath her bows like an
      infernal cauldron.
    </p>
    <p>
      Great as was the danger, there were still some so reckless as to make
      remarks upon my unique appearance, and turn the minds of many from that
      condition of religious revery and mental casting up and balancing of
      accounts, which the near proximity to death so imminently required; and
      certainly I did look queer&mdash;no boots, no coat, no drawers&mdash;but,
      lady reader, don't think my bosom was false, and I had no subuculus on. &ldquo;I
      didn't have anything else&rdquo; on&mdash;more truth than poetry, I ween.
      Sixteen young ladies, unmindful of danger, ran shrieking away; fourteen
      married ones walked leisurely to the stern of the boat, where the captain
      had been vainly before trying to drive them; whilst two old maids stood
      and looked at me in unconscious astonishment, wonderful amazement, and
      inexpressible surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look out!&rdquo; rang the shrill voice of the captain; and, with a dull, heavy
      thump, the boat struck the bank, jarring the marrow of every one on board,
      save myself&mdash;for, just before she struck, I calculated the distance,
      made my jump, landed safely, and was snugly ensconced behind a large log,
      hallooing for some one to bring me my clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      No damage of consequence, contrary to expectations, was done our craft;
      and after digging her out of the bank, we proceeded on our way, a heavy
      rain having succeeded the storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was lying in my state-room, ruminating sadly over the pleasureableness
      of being the laughing-stock of the whole boat, when my old adviser of the
      night previous entered the room, with too much laughter on his face to
      make his coming moral deduction of much force.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see now, Madison, the result of not having followed my advice. Had
      you been governed by me, the disagreeable event of the morning would never
      have occurred; you would have been in bed at the proper hour, slept during
      the proper hours, been ready dressed as a consequence at the breakfast
      hour, and not been the cause of such a mortal shock to the delicacy of so
      many delicate females, besides making a d&mdash;d unanimous fool of
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said but little in reply, but thought a great deal. I kept my room the
      balance of the trip, sickness being my plea.
    </p>
    <p>
      I transacted my business in the city, and chance made my old adviser and
      myself fellow-passengers and roommates again, on our upward trip. Night
      saw me regularly at the card-table, and my old friend at nine o'clock as
      constantly in bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was after his bed-hour when we reached Grand Gulf, where several
      lady-passengers intended leaving. They were congregated in the middle of
      the gentlemen's cabin, bringing out baggage and preparing to leave as soon
      as the boat landed.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the landing a large broad-horn was lazily sleeping, squatted on the
      muddy waters like a Dutch beauty over a warming-pan. Her steering-oar&mdash;the
      broad-horn's, not the beauty's&mdash;instead of projecting, as custom and
      the law requires, straight out behind, had swung round, and stood
      capitally for raking a boat coming up along side. The engines had stopped,
      but the boat had not lost the impetus of the steam, but was slowly
      approaching the broad-horn, when a crash was head&mdash;a state-room door
      was burst open, and out popped my ancient comrade, followed up closely by
      a sharp stick, in the shape of the greasy handle of the steering-oar. It
      passed directly through my berth, and would undeniably have killed me, had
      I been in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was my turn to exult now. I pulled &ldquo;Old Advice&rdquo; out from under the
      table, and, as I congratulated him on his escape, maliciously added, &ldquo;You
      see, now, that playing cards is not totally unattended with good effects.
      Had. I, agreeably to your advice, been in bed, I would now be a mangled
      corpse, and you enjoying the satisfaction that it was your counsel that
      had killed me; whilst, on the other hand, had you been playing, you would
      have escaped your fright, and the young ladies from Nankin in all
      probability would never have known you slept in a red bandana.&rdquo; I made a
      convert of him to my side; we sat down to a quiet game, and before twelve
      that night he broke me flat.

    <h2>
      THE DAY OF JUDGMENT.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">E</span> very one is
      acquainted with the horror that the presence of the small-pox, or the
      rumour&mdash;which is as bad&mdash;of its being in the neighbourhood,
      excites. A planter living some thirty or forty miles from where I was
      studying, had returned from New Orleans, where he had contracted, as it
      afterwards turned out, the measles, but which, on their first appearance,
      had been pronounced by a young, inexperienced physician, who was first in
      attendance, an undoubted case of small-pox. The patient was a nervous,
      excitable man, and consequently very much alarmed; wishing further advice,
      he posted a boy after my preceptor, who, desirous of giving me an
      opportunity of seeing the disease, took me with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The planter lived near a small town in the interior, now no more, but
      which, in the minds of its projectors&mdash;judging from its lithographed
      map&mdash;was destined to rival the first cities of the land. The nature
      of the disease was apparent in a moment to my preceptor's experienced eye;
      but the excitability and fear of the patient had aggravated the otherwise
      simple disease, so that it presented some really alarming symptoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      A liberal administration of the brandy bottle soon reassured the patient
      and moderated the disease, so that my preceptor, whose presence was
      urgently demanded at home, could intrust him to my care, giving me
      directions how to treat the case. He left for home, and I strutted about,
      proud in the consciousness of being attending physician. It being my first
      appearance in that capacity, you may imagine that the patient did not
      suffer for want of attention. I wore the enamel nearly off his teeth by
      the friction produced by requiring the protrusion of his tongue for
      examination, and examined his abdomen so often to detect hidden
      inflammation, that I almost produced, by my pommelling, what I was
      endeavouring to discover in the first place. In despite of the disease and
      doctor, the case continued to improve, and I intended leaving in the
      morning for home, when the alarm of the small-pox being in the settlement
      having spread, I was put in requisition to vaccinate the good people.
      Charging a dollar for each operation, children half price, I was reaping a
      harvest of small change, when the virus gave out, and plenty of calls
      still on hand. Knowing that there was no smallpox in the first instance,
      and apprehensive that the fears of the good folks, unless they imagined
      themselves protected, might produce bad effects. I committed a pious
      fraud, and found on the back of my horse, which fortunately had been
      galled lately, an ample supply of virus. My labours at length terminated,
      and I prepared to depart, taking the small town before-mentioned in my
      way; I dismounted at the tavern, to get a drink and have my horse watered.
      On entering, I found several acquaintances whom I did not expect to meet
      in that section of the country. Mutually rejoiced at the meeting, it did
      not take us long to get on the threshold of one of those wild carouses,
      which the convivial disposition of the Southerner&mdash;either by birth or
      adoption&mdash;so unfortunately disposes him to. The Bacchanalian temple
      was soon entered, and not a secret recess of its grand proportions but
      what was explored. Night closed upon the scene, and found us prepared for
      any wild freak or mad adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the southern autumn, when the dark-eyed night has just sufficient
      compassion on old winter's wooing to allow him the privilege of the shadow
      of a kiss,&mdash;just cool enough, in other words, they were, to reconcile
      us to a single blanket upon the bed, and draw from the meditative minds of
      poverty-stricken students a melancholy sigh, when the empty pocket
      reflects upon the almost equally naked back, and curses it for needing
      winter clothes at all at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      As yet, however, there had been no frost, and the forests still remained
      decked in their holiday suits, the gorgeous apparel of a southern clime.
    </p>
    <p>
      With those who have a soul that the shoemaker cannot save, this is the
      great season of camp-meetings, love-feasts, protracted preaching, and
      other religious festivals. At this particular time the religious world,
      and many who were not of that stamp, were on the lookout for the end of
      the world, and the day of judgment, which some theological calculator had
      figured up for this year, and no postponement on account of the weather,
      sure!
    </p>
    <p>
      The prediction had produced great excitement amongst all with whom the
      prophet had any credit; and where his credit stopped other commenced&mdash;for
      some of the knowing ones, who firmly believed the prophecy, purchased any
      amount of goods at exorbitant prices, at twelve months' credit, thinking
      they would be in &ldquo;Kingdom Come&rdquo; before the notes fell due.
    </p>
    <p>
      Camp-meetings were being held in all parts of the country, and prayers of
      all kinds, from the unpremeditated effusion of the conscience-stricken
      negro to the elaborate supplications of the regularly initiated
      circuit-rider, arose, making the welkin ring with the name of Jehovah. A
      large meeting was in full operation not far from the place where we were
      passing the night in less commendable pursuits; and, judging from the
      fervency of the prayers, declamations, singing, screamings, and
      glorifications, salvation was being obtained in a very satisfactory
      manner. The location of the camp was in the verge of the Loosa Chitta
      swamp, at the termination of a long lane, which extended from where we
      were.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was waning away, but still the zeal of the camp-meeting
      continued unabated, and bid fair to hail the morning. We had also reached
      our wildest state of excitement, and were consequently ready for any
      foolish scheme or reckless undertaking. The proposal of one of the most
      imaginative of the number, that we should personify the fiery consummation
      which revelation tells us shall terminate this world, met with unanimous
      and wild approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each man furnishing himself with a flowing robe of white, half the number&mdash;nearly
      thirty&mdash;carrying horns, and the remainder large turpentine torches,
      we prepared to make our descent upon the camp-meeting in the character of
      the &ldquo;Day of Judgment.&rdquo; There was a large stray mule in the stable yard of
      the tavern, and we cruelly impressed him as a chief actor. By this time
      the religionists, exhausted by their long-continued exertions, had sunk
      into repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saturating the mule's hide&mdash;which was long and shaggy&mdash;well with
      turpentine and tar, all but his head and neck, which we wrapped in a wet
      sheet, we led him to the mouth of the lane and applied a torch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quicker than lightning the fire spread over the body of the devoted
      animal. With a scream of terror and anguish it darted off up the lane in
      the direction of the camp, whilst we mounted, with our long mantles
      floating behind us, yelling like incarnate fiends, sounding our horns,
      and, our many torches flashing like meteors through the night, pressed on
      after it in hot and close pursuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      On! on! rushed the mule, the flames swelling tumultuously on every side,
      eddying above the trees, and lighting the darkness with a vivid, lurid
      gleam; fiercer and faster than the dread tempest, carrying death in its
      track, sped he on under the terrible infliction.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had nearly reached the camp-ground, when, as we approached the
      plantation of the widow H., which lay adjacent, we were discovered by an
      old negro, who, seated on the flat roof of his cabin, had gone fast
      asleep, watching through the long hours of the night, for fear that the
      end of the world, and the day of judgment, might slip upon him unawares.
    </p>
    <p>
      Waking at the critical time our hellish cortege approached, he gazed a
      moment, with eyes stretched to their utmost capacity, upon the rapidly
      nearing volume of fire; then springing from the roof, he ran shrieking his
      dolesome summons to the camp: &ldquo;White folks riz! De Laud be marsyful! De
      end of de warld an' de day of judgmen' hab pass, and here cums hell rite
      up de lane! Whoop! I love my Jesus! Master, cum!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The meeting, awakened from their slumbers by his turmoil, rushed out, and
      when they too saw the approaching fire-breathing mass, they believed with
      the negro, that the day of judgment had passed, and Pandemonium&mdash;hot
      at that&mdash;was coming with its awful torments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Supplications for mercy, screams of anguish, prayers and blasphemies,
      horror-stricken moans of the converts, the maniacal shouts of the
      conscience-stricken sinners, and the calm collected songs of the really
      righteous, swelled on the wind; mingled with the roaring of the flames,
      our piercing yells, discordant horns, and the horrible cries of the
      consuming animal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thousand echoes of the swamp took up the sound, and the wild-wood, if
      filled with screaming devils, could not have given back a more hideous
      outcry.
    </p>
    <p>
      On! on! sped the victim&mdash;we in his train&mdash;in his haste to reach
      the waters of the &ldquo;Loosa Chitta&rdquo; and allay his sufferings. The stream was
      nearly reached; with ecstasy the poor brute beheld the glistening waters;
      he sped on with accelerated steps&mdash;one more spring, and he would find
      surcease of anguish 'neath their cooling waves. But he was destined never
      to reach them; he fell exhausted on the brink, vainly endeavouring, with
      extended neck, to allay his fiery thirst; as the flame, now bereft of
      fuel, sent up its last flickering ray, the poor mule, with a low
      reproachful moan, expired.

    <h2>
      A RATTLESNAKE ON A STEAMBOAT.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>hortly before the
      usual time for wending my way North to the medical lectures, an
      opportunity was afforded me by an ingenious negro, who had caught the
      reptile asleep, of exchanging a well-worn blanket coat and two dimes,&mdash;principally
      in cash&mdash;for as fine a specimen of the Rattlesnake as ever delighted
      the eye or ear of a naturalist; nine inches across the small of the back,
      six feet seven-eighths of an inch in length, eyes like globular lightning,
      colours as gaudy as an Arkansas gal's apron, twenty-three rattles and a
      button, and a great propensity to make them heard, were the strong points
      of my purchase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Designing him as a propitiatory offering to one of the professors, my next
      care was to furnish him with a fitting habitation. Nothing better
      presenting itself, I made him one out of a pine box, originally designed
      for shoes, by nailing thin slats transversely, so as neither to exclude
      air or vision, but sufficiently close, I thought, to prevent him from
      escaping. The day for my departure arrived, and I had his snakeship
      carried on board the boat destined to bear me to V&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      where I would take an Ohio steamer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately for the quietude of my pet, on the Yazoo boat was a young
      cockney lady, who, hearing that there was a live rattlesnake on board,
      allowed her curiosity to overcome her maiden diffidence sufficiently to
      prefer a request that the young doctor &ldquo;would make 'is hanimal oiler?&rdquo; a
      process which the proverbial abstemiousness when in confinement of the
      &ldquo;hanimal&rdquo; was accomplishing rapidly without any intervention on my part.
      Politeness would not allow me to refuse, and as it was considerable of a
      novelty to the passengers, his snakeship was kept constantly stirred up,
      and his rattles had very little rest that trip.
    </p>
    <p>
      The steamer at length swung alongside the wharf boat at V&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      and transferring my baggage, I lounged about until the arrival of a boat
      would give me an opportunity of proceeding. The contents of the box were
      quickly discovered; and the snake had to undergo the same inflictions as
      the day previous&mdash;until, thoroughly vexed, I made them desist, and
      resolved thenceforth I would conceal his presence and allow him to travel
      as common baggage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The shades of night were falling fast,&rdquo; as the steamer Congress came
      booming along, and, after a detention of a few minutes for passengers,
      proceeded on her way, obtaining none however except myself. The snake-box
      was placed with the other baggage on the cabin deck in front of the
      &ldquo;social hall,&rdquo; jam up, as luck would have it, against one of the chimneys,
      making the location unpleasantly warm. It was one of those clear, luminous
      nights in autumn, when not a cloud dims the azure, and the heavens so
      &ldquo;beautifully blue,&rdquo; (Alas! poor Neal,) are gleaming with their myriad
      stars, when the laughing breeze lifts the hair off the brow and presses
      the cheek with as soft a touch as the pulpy lips of a maiden in her first
      essay at kissing. The clear, croupy cough of the steamer was echoed back
      in prolonged asthmatic strains from the dark woods lining the river, like
      an army of cowled gigantic monks come from their cells to see a steamboat.
      Supper was over, and the beauty of the night had enticed the majority of
      the passengers from the cabin to the open deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      A goodly number, myself amongst the rest, were seated in front of the
      social hall, smoking our cigars, and swapping yarns of all climes, sizes,
      nations, and colours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sitting a few yards from me, the most prominent personage of the group,
      smoking a chiboque, and regaling the crowd with the manner in which he
      choked a &ldquo;Cobra de Capello&rdquo; to death that crawled into his hammock in
      India, was an old English sailor, who, from his own account, had sailed
      over all the world, and through some parts of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weighing the words down with a heavy ballast of oaths, he said he &ldquo;wasn't
      afraid of anything in the snake line, from the sea serpent down to the
      original snake that tempted Eve.&rdquo; I asked him if he had ever met the
      rattlesnake since he had been in America, thinking I would put his courage
      to the test on the morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seen a rattlesnake? Yes, enough to sink a seventy-four? Went to Georgia
      on purpose to kill them. Pshaw! To think a man that had killed a boa
      constrictor, fair fight, should be fraid of a little noisy flirt of a
      snake that never grew bigger round than a marlin spike!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the boat was running a bend near in shore, and the glare,
      of a huge fire at a wood-yard was thrown directly under the chair of the
      braggart, when, to my utter amazement I saw there, snugly coiled up, the
      huge proportions of my <i>snake!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      I was so astonished and horrified that I could neither speak nor move. I
      had left him securely fastened in his cage, and yet there he was at
      liberty, in his deadly coil, his eyes gleaming like living coals. The
      light was intercepted, and the foot of the sailor moving closer to the
      reptile it commenced its warning rattle, but slowly and irregularly,
      showing it was not fully aroused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; exclaimed a dozen voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      The foot being withdrawn, the rattling ceased before its nature or source
      could be clearly traced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Twas the steam escaping,&rdquo; said one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A goose hissing,&rdquo; said another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A trick to scare the sailor,&rdquo; thought a good many; but <i>I knew it was a
      rattlesnake in his deadly coil!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      The horror of that moment I shall not attempt to describe; every second I
      expected to hear the shriek of the sailor as the deadly fangs would
      penetrate his flesh, and I knew if a vein were stricken no power on earth
      could avail him, and I powerless to warn him of his danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It sounded monstrous like a rattlesnake!&rdquo; observed a passenger, &ldquo;but
      there are no doctors or fool students on board, and nobody but cusses like
      them would be taking snakes 'bout.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was gwine up the Massassip wunst when a rattlesnake belonging to a
      medercal student on board, got out and bit one of the passengers; the poor
      crittur didn't live ten minutes, and the sawbone's 'prentice not much
      longer I reckon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My hair stood on end, for there was an earnestness about the man that told
      me he was not joking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did'nt kill him, surely?&rdquo; asked some one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! we did'nt 'zactly kill him, sich as cuttin' his throat, or
      puttin' lead in his holler cimblin, for that would have been takin' the
      law inter our own hands; but we guv him five hundred lashes, treated him
      to a coat of tar and feathers, made a clean crop of one ear, and a
      swal-low-forked-slit-under-bit-and-half-crop of the other, an' put him out
      on a little island up to his mouth in water an' the river risin' a plum
      foot an hour!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not knowing but a similar fate might soon be mine, in agony, with the cold
      sweat streaming over me. I listened to this infernal recital of an
      instance of the summary punishment termed &ldquo;Lynch Law,&rdquo; to which the
      unavailability of the statute law so often drove the early settlers, and
      which, unfortunately for the fair character of the South and West, is not
      yet entirely abolished.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sailor must again have moved his foot closer than agreeable to the
      snake, for his infernal rattling recommenced, and <i>this time</i> clear,
      loud, and continuous to the tutored ear, indicating great danger, the
      prelude to a fatal spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shook off my lethargy, and shrieked out, &ldquo;Don't move for your life! a
      light! for God's sake bring a light! Quick! quick!&rdquo; None moved&mdash;thinking
      I was jesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mister,&rdquo; spoke the sailor, &ldquo;if it's a trick to scare me, you'll miss the
      figure with your child's rattle. Jes bring one of your real rattlesnakes
      along, and I'll show you whether he can frighten an English sailor or
      not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hearing me calling so loudly for a light, the mate, a stalwart Irishman,
      came running up with a large torch, but hardly had he reached the deck,
      when he discovered the monster&mdash;his head drawn back ready for
      striking.

      &ldquo;Snake! snake!&rdquo; yelled he, punching at him with his glaring torch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whereabouts, you lubber?&rdquo; said the sailor, still suspecting a trick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Under your feet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sailor looked down, and beheld the hideous reptile directly under his
      chair. With a loud yell, he made but one spring over the guards into the
      river.

      &ldquo;Whose is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lynch the rascal!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kill the scoundrel!&rdquo; swelled on the air, mingled with the crashing of
      broken doors and chairs, the oaths and rushing of terrified men, and the
      screaming of still more terrified women, who knew not what to fear, while
      clear and distinct above the infernal melée arose the piercing rattle of
      the snake, who, writhing his huge proportions about, and striking at
      everything near him, seemed to glory in the confusion he had created.
    </p>
    <p>
      A shot was heard, and then the coil collapsed, and the rattling slowly
      ceased. The snake was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who brought him on board?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's lynch the scoundrel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are there any more of them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's the box he got out of!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>My name was on it</i> in large capitals.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Throw it overboard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Throw it overboard!&rdquo; I yelled out, &ldquo;it may have more in it, throw it
      overboard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No sooner said than done, and as the only evidence of my participation
      floated over the wave, no one was louder in his denunciation, no one
      wanted to be shown&mdash;in order that he might be lynched&mdash;the
      rascal that brought it on board, more than I did, except, perhaps, it was
      the sailor, who, now thoroughly humbled, stood shivering in his wet
      clothes by the furnace, ready to acknowledge that the &ldquo;little, noisy flirt
      of an American snake, no larger than a marlin' spike,&rdquo; was &ldquo;some snakes&rdquo;
       certain.

    <h2>
      FRANK AND THE PROFESSOR.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t wanted but a few
      days of the commencement of the lectures. Having procured a
      boarding-house, and furnished myself with the necessary books and tickets,
      I was sauntering over the city, amusing myself with the many strange
      sights which pass unnoticed by the denizens, yet have such an attraction
      for the grave rat just emerged from the country, when I was hailed by a
      Southern acquaintance&mdash;a rattling, red-headed fellow, of Irish
      descent; the proof of which, the tip of his tongue always presented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you, Tensas&mdash;when did you arrive&mdash;slayed many the past
      summer? I brought them to their senses in my section, certain; for the
      grand jury found a true bill against me in thirteen cases for
      manslaughter. Let's take a drink. Ha! ha! I want to tell you of an
      occurrence that happened to old&mdash;&mdash;. Bless his sugar-loaf head!
      if he'd only let me left when I first wanted, I'd always hereafter write
      his name without the first letter. You see, Ten, I had letters of
      introduction for the old chap; and I thought I'd deliver them early, and
      get on his good side before the winter's course of sprees commenced. I
      suppose you know, as he's a widower, and writing a book, and deeply in
      debt&mdash;to his Maker&mdash;that he lives up in the college, and cooks
      his own victuals, and has quite a retired life of it, as my uncle the
      postmaster remarked about his own situation, when the department gave him
      his walking-papers. Well, I went up to his room when everything was quiet
      about the college, thinking what a nice scientific disquisition we could
      have, if the old gentleman, knowing I was a hunter, was to ask me why the
      rings on a coon's tail didn't grow parallel to the axis of its long
      diameter, instead of the short; or, to which fowl did a young duck owe the
      most filial love&mdash;to the duck that laid the egg, or the hen that
      hatched it? And such like questions, worthy of being lucubrated upon by
      great minds only.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found the old gentleman very complacent and easy, standing up in his
      night-shirt and making whiskey-toddy in a teapot, whilst he gave the last
      touch to an introductory oration for the P. T. S.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Prof.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, I presume?' said I, knocking at the
      door after I had opened it&mdash;thinking, that as I had forgotten it at
      first, it would be an imputation on Southern manners to neglect it
      entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'The same,' said he, with the most perfect composure, knocking his
      oration into the stove, upsetting his punch, and leaving half of his
      subuculus on a nail as he jumped into the next room; whilst I, pulling off
      my boots, and finishing what little punch had not run out, told him not to
      distress himself putting on his best clothes, or preparing much dinner, as
      I had lunched very heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a few moments he returned, and seemed to be in the best humour
      imaginable at the perfect homeability I was surrounding myself with.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thinking him a queer one, I resolved on making myself as agreeable as
      possible, as I saw from the way his face was screwed up he had the
      toothache badly and needed comfort; so I asked him how long his wife had
      been dead, and whether there was any truth in the report that he was
      courting a widow on Fifth Street; also, if he bought his Irish whiskey by
      the gallon or cask; he apparently did not hear these kind inquiries, but
      asked if I had not a letter of introduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'True for you, I have, and there it is,' handing him a fifty dollar bill;
      it belongs to me, and I'm Frank Me&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;; take the
      price of your winter's jaw out of it, and we'll see what's in town with
      the balance.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He got well of his toothache in a moment. 'Happy to make your
      acquaintance; you're from the southern swamps, plenty of chill and fever
      there; permit me to read for your critical attention a few pages I have
      written in my book on the subject.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'With the greatest pleasure in the world,' I replied; 'allow me to
      subscribe to your work; deduct it out of the fifty.' He commenced reading
      a description of a Mississippi agur, and cuss me if it wasn't so natural I
      shivered all over; and the tears pop't out of my eyes like young pigeons
      out of a loft, when I thought of the last shake I had in far distant
      Massassip, sitting on a muddy log fighting the mosquitoes, and waiting for
      a steamboat to bear me from her friendly bosom. You ought to have heard
      him when he described the awful effects it had upon our gals, developing
      their spleens, and bringing the punkin to their blessed faces; there was a
      pathos in his language, a tremor in his voice, soft as the warbling of a
      he-dove before he pitches into a pea-patch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Then it is,' he read, 'when the deleterious emanations of the
      decomposing vegetation have penetrated the inmost recesses and mysterious
      intricacies of the corporeal constituents of the intellectual inhabitants,
      that humanity instigates the benevolent individual to mournfully and sadly
      deliberate over the probable effects, after a perpetuity of continuance of
      such morbific impressions.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was delighted at the grand simplicity of his expression, and was giving
      my approbation too much vent, when tap, tap, went something at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'And even beauteous woman,' continued the professor, 'goes a'&mdash;tap,
      tap&mdash;'whilst ever is heard'&mdash;tap, tap&mdash;' and nature
      assimilating'&mdash;tap, tap&mdash;'mournfully weeps over the silent'&mdash;bom,
      bom, went the outsider, growing impatient. 'Bless me! who's there? come
      in,'&mdash;and an hour-glass, the sand nearly out, was substituted for the
      punch-bowl&mdash;'Come in;' the door opened, and gave admittance to what
      would have been a handsome young woman, had the care in her heart not
      written 'at home' so legibly on her cheek. 'Take a seat, ma'am.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I will call again, professor,' said I, rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'No, no, sir, sit down, sir. Madam, how can I serve you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I am in a great hurry, professor,' I said again, seizing my hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'No, sir, I insist you must not leave. Madam, what do you want?' and the
      poor professor jumped from his seat to the door, and from the door to his
      seat, asking, almost sternly, 'Madam, what do you want?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I'm a poor widow, with a large family of children, and hearing that you
      were a very charitable gentleman, and&mdash;' &ldquo;'Professor, I cannot stand
      this pitiable narrative. Madam, there is some money for you. You must
      indeed excuse me. I shall not be able to restrain my tears.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'No, sir, stay, I command you, I insist. Woman, what do you want? in the
      name of virtue, what do you want?' The widow commenced her piteous appeal
      again, when, quite overcome, I rushed from the room, followed by the voice
      of the ruined professor, who feared that his reputation was for ever gone.
      'Woman, in the name of Jehovah, what <i>do you</i> want?'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Frank! Death's dark garniture hath clothed his piercing eye;
      friendship and sorrow no more thrill his heart, and the noisome worm
      revels in the home of high and noble daring. He died! not on the sick-bed,
      with mourning friends gathered around, but on the battle-field, fighting
      for his country, on the victor soldier's bed&mdash;the body of his foe.
      And of all the warm leal hearts that were stilled, of all the true spirits
      that floated up to God, from thy glorious but bloody field, Buena Vista!
      silence fell not on a nobler breast&mdash;not a truer soul went up than
      rose from thy bosom, Frank&mdash;true friend of my early manhood!

    <h2>
      THE CURIOUS WIDOW.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>uring my first
      course of lectures I became a boarder at the house of a widow lady, the
      happy mother of a brace and a half of daughters, the quartette possessing
      so much of the distinguishing characteristic of the softer sex, that I
      often caught myself wondering in what nook or corner of their diminutive
      skulls they kept the rest of the faculties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Occupying the same room that I did, were two other students from the same
      section of country as myself, and possessing pretty much the same tastes
      and peculiarities. One thing certain we agreed in, and that was a
      detestation of all curiosity-stricken women; for never were poor devils
      worse bothered by researches than we were. Not a pocket of any garment
      left in our rooms could remain unexamined, not a letter remain on our
      table unread, nor scarcely a word of conversation pass without a soft,
      subdued breathing at the key-hole telling us we were eavesdropped. Matters
      came at length to such a pass, and so thorough became the annoyance, that
      nothing but the difficulty of obtaining suitable accommodation elsewhere,
      prevented us from bidding a tender adieu to the widow, and promising to
      pay her our board bill as soon as our remittances arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the evil had to be endured for a while, at least, we soon invented and
      arranged a plan for breaking her of her insatiable curiosity, and making
      her, what she was in other respects, a good landlady.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boarding-house was a large two-story frame, with a flight of steps on
      one side, extending from the street to the second story, so as to give
      admittance to the boarders without the necessity of opening the front door
      or disturbing the family when we came in late at night. It was very cold
      weather, and our mess were busily engaged every night until a late hour at
      the dissecting-rooms, and it was during this necessary absence that the
      widow made her researches and investigations. The <i>subject</i> that we
      were engaged upon was one of the most hideous specimens of humanity that
      ever horrified the sight. The wretch had saved his life from the hangman
      by dying the eve before the day of execution, and we, by some process or
      other, became the possessors of his body. Just emaciated sufficiently to
      remove the fatty tissue, and leave the muscles and blood-vessels finely
      developed, still he was so hideous that nothing but my devotion to
      anatomy, and the fineness of the subject, could reconcile me to the
      dissection; and even after working a week upon him, I never caught a
      glimpse of his countenance but what I had the nightmare in consequence. He
      was one of that peculiar class called Albinoes, or white negroes. Every
      feature was deformed and unnatural; a horrible hare-lip, the cleft
      extending half way up his nose externally, and pair of tushes projecting
      from his upper jaw, completed his bill of horrors. It was with him, or
      rather his face, that we determined to cure our landlady of her prying
      propensities.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the work of a few minutes to slice the face from the skull, and
      'arrange it so that from any point of view it would look horrible. Having
      procured a yard of oilcloth, we sewed it to the face, and then rolled it
      carefully up; tying this securely, we next enveloped it in a number of
      wrappers, fastening each separately, so that her curiosity would be
      excited to the utmost degree before the package could be completely
      opened. At the usual hour we returned home, carrying our extra face along;
      not, however, without many a shudder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon entering our room, we saw that the spoiler had been there, although
      she had endeavoured to leave things as near the condition she found them
      in as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a hearty malediction upon all curious women, we eat our cold snack,
      which the kind-hearted widow&mdash;for, despite of her being a widow, she
      was really kind-hearted&mdash;always had awaiting our return, and retired
      to rest, determined that the morrow's night should bring all things even.
    </p>
    <p>
      I endeavoured to sleep; but that hideous face, which we had locked
      securely in a trunk, kept staring at me through its many envelopes&mdash;and
      when the cold winter's sun shone in at the casement, it found me still
      awake Nervous and irritated, I descended to breakfast; and nothing but the
      contemplation of my coming revenge prevented me from treating the widow
      with positive impoliteness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bless her not-despairing-of-marrying-again spirit! who could keep angry
      with her? Such a sweet smile of ineffable goodness and spiritual innocence
      rested on her countenance, that I almost relented of my purpose, but my
      love-letters read, my duns made evident, my poetry criticized by eyes to
      which Love would not lend his blindness, to make perfect; and then&mdash;she
      is a widow! My heart, at this last reflection, became immediately barred
      to the softening influences of forgiveness, and I determined in all
      hostility to <i>face</i> her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lectures that day, as far as we were concerned, fell upon listless
      ears, for we were thinking too much of what the night was to bring forth,
      to pay much attention to them. The day at last had its close,&mdash;I
      suppose father Time, its tailor, furnished them on tick. It had been
      snowing all the evening, and at supper we complained bitterly, how
      disagreeable it would be walking to the college, and working that night,
      and wished that we were not dissecting, so that we might stay at home and
      answer the letters we had received from home that day. &ldquo;Business could not
      be neglected for the weather,&rdquo; was our conclusion expressed to the widow;
      so after supper we donned our dissecting-clothes, and putting the package
      for the widow in a coat pocket, hung it up in a prominent place, so it
      could be found readily. Telling the family we would not be back until
      late, and making as much noise as possible with our feet, so as to assure
      her we were going, we left the house as if for the college.
    </p>
    <p>
      We went no further, however, than to the nearest coffeehouse, where, by
      the time we had smoked a cigar, we judged sufficient time had elapsed for
      the widow to commence researches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Returning to the boarding-house, we pulled off our boots and noiselessly
      ascended the outside steps, the door at the head of which we had left
      open. There was a short passage leading from it to the door of our room,
      which we had left closed, but now perceived to be ajar. Silently, as a
      doctor speaking of the patients he has lost, we approached it, and, on
      peeping in, to our great gratification found everything working as we had
      desired. The widow had got the package out, and was occupied in viewing it
      attentively from all sides, and studying the character of the knots of the
      ligatures embracing it, so she could restore everything to its original
      condition, when her curiosity was satisfied as to its contents. Having
      impressed its shape, and the peculiarity of tie, well upon her mind, she
      proceeded to take off the first cover, which was soon done, when a similar
      envelope met her eye; this, after undergoing the same scrutiny, was
      removed, when yet another met her gaze; this detached, and still the
      kernel was unreached; some six or eight were taken off, and at length she
      came to the last, the oil-skin. Poor old lady! she has long been where the
      curiosity of life never penetrates, and the grandest and most awful
      mystery of our nature is revealed; yet, I see her now, as the last
      envelope of the mysterious package was reached, and when a gleam of
      satisfaction shot like an erysipelatous blush over her anxious face, as
      she saw the consummation of her long expectancy approaching. There she
      stood, with spectacles buried so deeply 'neath her brows as almost to
      appear a portion of her visage; neck&mdash;not of apoplectic proportions&mdash;elongated
      to its utmost capacity; lips&mdash;from which the ruby of youth had
      departed,&mdash;wide disclosed,&mdash;showing what our swamp lands are
      famous for&mdash;big gums and old snags; in fact, the embodiment of woman
      in her hour of curiosity. Holding the package in one hand and the end of
      the oil-cloth in the other, she commenced unrolling it slowly, for fear
      some peculiarity of its arrangement might escape her; her back was towards
      the door, which we had nearly opened awide, and anxiously awaiting the <i>denouement</i>;
      it came at last,&mdash;and never shall I forget the expression of that old
      woman's face as the last roll left the hellish countenance, and it lay in
      all its awful hideousness upon her extended palm,&mdash;the fiendish
      tushes protruding from the parted lips,&mdash;still wearing the agony of
      the death-second,&mdash;and the eyes enclosed in their circle of red,
      gazing up into hers with their dull vacant stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ay, but she was a firm-nerved woman. If metempsychosis be a true doctrine,
      her spirit must have once animated, in the chivalrous times, a steel-clad
      knight of the doughtiest mould. She did not faint&mdash;did not vent a
      scream&mdash;but gazed upon its awfulness in silence, as if her eyes were
      riveted to it for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      We felt completely mortified to think that our well-laid scheme had failed&mdash;that
      we had failed to terrify her; when, to perfect our chagrin, she broke into
      a low laugh. We strode into the room, determined to express in words what
      our deeds had evidently failed to convey; when, ere she had become fully
      aware of our presence, we noticed her laughter was becoming hysterical. We
      spoke to her&mdash;shook her by the shoulder&mdash;but still she laughed
      on, increasing in vehemence and intensity. It began to excite attention in
      the lower apartments, and even in the street; and soon loud knocks and
      wondering exclamations began to alarm us for the consequences of our
      participation. We strove to take the fearful object from her, but she
      clung to it with the tenacity of madness, or a young doctor to his first
      scientific opinion. &ldquo;She is gone demented!&rdquo; we exclaimed; &ldquo;we had better
      be leaving&rdquo;&mdash;when a rush up the steps and through the passage, cut
      off our retreat, and told us the daughters and crowd were coming; but
      still the old lady laughed on, fiercer, faster, shriller than before. In
      rushed the crowd&mdash;a full charge for the room, impelled by the ramrod
      of curiosity&mdash;but ere they had time to discover the cause of the
      commotion, or make a demonstration, the widow ceased her laughter, and,
      putting on an expression of the most supreme contempt, coolly remarked:&mdash;&ldquo;Excuse
      me, gentlemen, if I have caused you any inconvenience by my unusual
      conduct. I was just <i>smiling aloud</i> to think what fools these
      students made of themselves when they tried to scare me with a dead
      nigger's face, when I had slept with a drunken husband for twenty years!&rdquo;
       The crowd mizzled; and we, too, I reckon, between that time and the next
      up-heaving of the sun.

      Turning my head as the office door opened, my eyes fell on the
      well-developed proportions of a huge flatboatsman who entered the room
      wearing a countenance, the expression of which would seem to indicate that
      he had just gone into the vinegar manufacture with a fine promise of
      success.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you pull teeth, young one?&rdquo; said he to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and noses too,&rdquo; replied I, fingering my slender moustache, highly
      indignant at the juvenile appellation, and bristling up by the side of the
      huge Kentuckian, till I looked as large as a thumb-lancet by the side of
      an amputating knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn't get riled, young doc, I meant no insult, sarten, for my teeth
      are too sore to 'low your boots to jar' them as I swallered you down. I
      want a tooth pulled, can you manage the job? Ouch! criminy, but it hurts!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, I can pull your tooth. Is it an incisor, or a dens sapientiæ?
      one of the decidua, or a permanent grinder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a sizer, I reckon. It's the largest tooth in my jaw, anyhow, you can
      see for yourself,&rdquo; and the Kentuckian opening the lower half of his face,
      disclosed a set of teeth that clearly showed that his half of the
      alligator lay above.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A molar requires extraction,&rdquo; said I, as he laid his finger on the aching
      fang.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A molar! well, I'll be cus't but you doctors have queer names for things!
      I reckon the next time I want a money-puss a molear will be extracted too;
      ouch! What do you ax for pulling teeth, doc? I want to git rid of the
      pesky thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A dollar, sir,&rdquo; said I, pulling out the case of instruments and placing a
      chair for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A dollar! dollar h&mdash;ll! do you think the Yazoo Pass is full of kegs
      of speshy? I'd see you mashed under a hogshead of pork 'fore I'd give you
      a dollar to pull the thing,&rdquo; and picking up his hat, which he had dashed
      on the floor on his first entrance, off he started.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing some fun in store, I winked at the rest of the students, whom the
      loudness of our conversation had called from the other rooms of the
      capacious office, and requested the subject to return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's no use, stranger; I'd squirm all day fust 'fore I'd give you a
      dollar to pull every tooth in my head,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mister, times are hard, and I'll pull your tooth for half a
      dollar,&rdquo; said I, determined, if necessary, to give him pay before I would
      lose the pulling of his tooth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll have to come down a notch lower, doc I wants to interduce Kaintuck
      fashions on a Southern sile; and up thar, you can get a tooth pulled and
      the agur 'scribed for, fur a quarter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but recollect, it's harder to pull teeth here than it is in
      Kentucky.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't care a cuss; dimes is plentyer. I don't want to 'be stingy, though,
      doc, and I'll tell you what I'll do. I feels sorter bad from eatin' a
      mud-cat yesterday. I'll gin you a quarter to pull my tooth, if you'll
      throw in a dose of castor ile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a bargain,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I couldn't possibly afford to do it so low if I
      didn't manufacture my own oil, and pull teeth on the 'Mississippi patent
      plan,' without the least pain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'se struck a breeze of luck, sure, to get it 'stracted without
      hurtin', for I 'spected it would make all things pop, by hoecake.&rdquo; And
      &ldquo;all things did pop,&rdquo; certain, as the poor devil found to his sorrow,
      before the &ldquo;Mississippi patent plan&rdquo; was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room in which we were was the operating one of the office, where
      patients were examined, and surgical operations performed. It was
      furnished with all the usual appliances of such an establishment. In the
      middle of the room, securely fastened to the floor by screws, was a large
      arm-chair, with head-board and straps, to confine the body and limbs of
      the patient whilst the operator was at work, in such cases as required it.
      On either side of the house, driven into the wall, were a couple of iron
      bolts, to which were fastened blocks and pulleys, used when reducing old
      dislocations, when all milder means had failed. The chair, pulleys, and a
      small hand-vice were the apparatus intended to be used by me in the
      extraction of the Kentuckian's tooth, by the &ldquo;Mississippi patent plan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The patient watched all our preparations&mdash;for I quickly let the other
      students into the plan of the intended joke&mdash;with great interest, and
      seemed hugely tickled at the idea of having his tooth pulled without pain
      &ldquo;for a quarter,&rdquo; and a dose of castor-oil extra.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything being ready, we invited the subject to take his seat in the
      operating chair, telling him it was necessary, agreeably to our mode of
      pulling teeth, that the body and arms should be perfectly quiet; that
      other doctors, who hadn't bought the right to use the 'patent plan,' used
      the pullikins, whilst I operated with the pulleys. I soon had him
      immoveably strapped to the chair, hand and foot. Introducing the hand-vice
      in his mouth, which, fortunately for me, was a large one, I screwed it
      fast to the offending tooth, then connecting it with the first cord of the
      pulleys and intrusting it to the hands of two experienced assistants, I
      was ready to commence the extraction. Giving the word, and singing, &ldquo;Lord,
      receive this sinner's soul,&rdquo; we pulled slowly, so as to let the full
      strain come on the neck bones gradually.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though I live till every hair on my head is as hollow as a dry skull, I
      shall never forget the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clothed in homespun of the copperas hue, impotent to help himself, his
      body immoveably fixed to the chair, his neck gradually extending itself,
      like a terrapin's emerging from its shell, his eyes twice their natural
      size, and projected nearly out of their sockets, his mouth widely
      distended, with the vice hidden in its cavity, and the connexion of the
      rope being behind his cheeks, giving the appearance as if we had cast
      anchor in his stomach, and were heaving it slowly home, sat the
      Kentuckian, screaming and cursing that we were pulling his head off
      without moving the tooth, and that the torment was awful. But I coolly
      told him 'twas the usual way the 'Mississippi patent plan' worked, and
      directed my assistants to keep up their steady pull.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have not yet fully determined, as it was the first and last experiment,
      which would have come first, his head or the tooth, for all at once the
      rope gave way, precipitating, without much order or arrangement, the
      assistants into the opposite corner of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The operating chair not being as securely screwed down as usual, was
      uptorn by the shock of the retrograde motion acquired, when the rope
      broke, and landed the Kentuckian on his back in the most distant side of
      the room; as he fell, he struck the side of his face against the wall, and
      out came the vice, with a large tooth in its fangs. He raged like one of
      his indigenous thunderstorms, and demanded to be released. Fearing some
      hostile demonstration when the straps were unfastened, we took occasion to
      cut them with a long bowie knife. He rose up, spitting blood and shaking
      himself, as if he was anxious to get rid of his clothes. &ldquo;H&mdash;l, Doc,
      but she's a buster! I never seed such a tooth. I recon no common fixments
      would have fotch it; but I tell you, sirree, it hurt awful; I think it's
      the last time the 'Mississippi Patent Plan' gets me in its holt. Here's a
      five-dollar Kaintuck bill, take your pay and gin us the change.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seeing he was in such good humour, I should have spared him, but his
      meanness disgusted me, and I thought I would carry the joke a little
      further. On examining his mouth, I suddenly discovered, as was the case,
      that I had pulled the wrong tooth, but I never told him, and he had too
      much blood in his mouth to discover it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curse the luck,&rdquo; I exclaimed, &ldquo;by Jupiter I have lost my bet. I didn't
      break the infernal thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lost what?&rdquo; inquired the patient, alternately spitting out blood, and
      cramming in my tobacco.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, a fine hat. I bet the old boss that the first tooth I pulled on my
      'Mississippi Patent Plan,' I either broke the neck of the patient or his
      jaw-bone, and I have done neither.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you never pull a tooth that way before? why, you told me you'd pulled
      a hundred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but they all belonged to dead men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if the rope hadn't guv way, I reckon there'd bin another dead man's
      pulled. Cuss you, you'd never pulled my tooth if I hadn't thought you had
      plenty of 'sperience; but gin me my change, I wants to be gwine to the
      boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I gave the fellow his change for the five-dollar bill, deducting the
      quarter, and the next day, when endeavouring to pass it, I found we had
      both made a mistake. I had pulled the wrong tooth, and he had given me a
      counterfeit bill.

    <h2>
      VALERIAN AND THE PANTHER.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> had just returned
      from attendance on my first course of medical lectures. Although not a
      graduate, I had all the pruriency of a young neophyte, and felt very
      desirous of an occasion wherein my Esculapian acquirements could be
      exhibited, from call, visit, patient, disease, diagnosis, prognosis,
      treatment, to cure; or else ominously and sorrowingly murmur to the
      bereaved friends who are taking the measure&mdash;&ldquo;if he'd only sent for
      me sooner!&rdquo; I wanted a case, the management all to myself, from comma to
      period, white, black, old, young, maid, wife, widow, masculine, feminine,
      old bachelor, or Indian, I cared not which; a patient was what I wanted,
      and the shape in which it would come, however questionable, I was
      indifferent to. The country adjacent to the village where I was studying,
      is, on two sides, swamp of the vilest, muddiest nature imaginable, with
      occasional tracts of fine land, generally situated on some bayou or lake;
      frequently an &ldquo;island&rdquo; of tillable land will be found rising out of the
      muddy swamp, accessible to footmen or horse only, when the river is within
      its banks, varying in size from fifty to two hundred acres; and, wherever
      existing, generally occupied by a small <i>planter</i>. Every farmer in
      the South is a planter, from the &ldquo;thousand baler&rdquo; to the rough, unshaved,
      unkempt squatter, who raises just sufficient corn and cotton to furnish a
      cloak for stealing the year's supply.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few hours' ride from town was one of these islands, &ldquo;pre-empted&rdquo; by a
      man named Spiffle, whose principal business was to fatigue him devising
      ways and means to live without work. He would have scorned to hoe an hour
      in his corn patch, and yet would not have hesitated a moment to pursue a
      deer or bear for days, with all the indefatigability of a German
      metaphysical philosopher studying an incomprehensibility. But hunting deer
      and bear, though it brought more sweat and fatigue in an hour than the
      hardest day's work, was sport; so was drinking whiskey, and between the
      two, Jim Spiffle had little time to extend the limits of his demesnes, or
      multiply the com forts of his household circle, wherein a wife and a dozen
      children attested Jim's obedience to scripture.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a sultry day in June, and I am about describing the external
      appearance of Jim's pre-emption. A small patch of green and waving corn,
      surrounded by a brush fence, save where it is eked out, by the side of an
      antiquated log-cabin, with a dirt chimney, around whose top the smoke is
      lying in dense heaps, too lazy to curl; one or two bedraggled hens, by
      noisy cackling, are endeavouring to inform the mistress that their diurnal
      recumbencies are consummated&mdash;whilst the cock of the walk, desirous
      of egging them on to increased exertions, struts majestically before them,
      waving one feather, constituting his tail, and seriously meditates a crow;
      but when he reflects that the exertion of flapping his wings must premise,
      contents himself with a low chuckle of admiration. An old hound, mangy and
      blear-eyed, is intent upon a deer's leg; and, as he gnaws its tough
      sinews, tries to delude himself into the belief that it is a delectable
      morsel from the ham. A boy of some thirteen winters, in full dress swamp
      costume (a short, well-worn shirt), rifle in hand, at a short distance
      from the house, is endeavouring to allay the mental and bodily disquietude
      of a fox-squirrel, so that they both may be on the same side of a chunky
      gum, up which the aforesaid squirrel, on the approach of the incipient
      Nimrod, had incontinently retreated. Spiffle, jun., sneaks round to the
      south side, but &ldquo;funny&rdquo; hangs on the north, east, and west&mdash;back to
      the north and south, all in vain! All the points of the mariner's compass
      are traversed, but still the cunning squirrel evades his foe, who, venting
      his malediction, finally retires from the pursuit, muttering, &ldquo;Cuss you! I
      was only going through the motions; the rifle ain't loaded!&rdquo; The lord of
      the soil, extended to his full proportions, is lying on a log, beneath a
      shady bush; a branch of which is bent down and so ingeniously arranged,
      that when the breeze moves, it will scratch his head; his mouth is full of
      tobacco&mdash;and as he sleeps, true to his nature, his right hand is
      busily engaged stealing a couple of dimes and an old jack-knife out of his
      own pocket; his jaws are relaxed, and the huge, well-chewed quid gleams
      beautifully dark from the profundity of mouth; a gentle titillation on his
      lips half arouses him, and, champing his jaws with an emphasis, his waking
      senses are saluted by the yell of his eldest born, who, on the failure of
      his squirrel enterprise, finding dad asleep, had made an heroic attempt to
      hook his sire's quid out of the deep abyss. The poor boy pays dearly for
      the attempted larceny&mdash;three fingers hanging by mere shreds of skin,
      are the attestations of his dad's strength of jaw. The scream of the poor
      devil, and the boisterous grief of the miserable squatter, who, though the
      &ldquo;Arab&rdquo; of the swamp, has still a father's feelings, brings from the cabin
      a form which, begrimed with dirt, and haggard with premature age, would
      scarcely be taken for the best of God's works&mdash;a woman&mdash;but such
      she was; and her tears and outcries also gave evidence that she, too,
      amidst the heart-hardenings of poverty, contumely, and lowliness, had
      still gushing up in her heart the pure waters of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lordy grashus!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;you have ruined the child! Oh! how could you
      doit? You, a man grown, and him, your own son! Oh, Jim!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Twasn't my fault, Betsy,&rdquo; answered poor Jim, &ldquo;'twasn't my fault! Oh!
      what must I do? He's gwine into 'vulshuns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jump on the critter and git the doctor!&rdquo; said Betsy. &ldquo;Quick, Jim! Oh,
      Lordy! only twelve children&mdash;and to lose one of them!&rdquo; and the poor
      mother sobbed as if her heart were rending; whilst Jim, jumping on a
      belter horse than befitted his circumstances, made all haste for town,
      whither he arrived about dinner-time&mdash;and dashing up with frantic
      haste to the office-door, yelled out, &ldquo;Doctor! oh, doctor! I've bit my
      son's hand off, and he's dying, sarten! Come, quick! dear doctor! that's a
      good old hoss!&mdash;oh, do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the &ldquo;good old hoss&rdquo; not responding to his appeal, he dismounted, and
      rushed in, repeating his cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter? what's the matter? who's sick?&rdquo; said I, rushing in
      from a back room&mdash;one book open in my right hand, and a ponderous
      tome under my left arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! young doctor, where's the old man? I've bit my son's arm off, and
      he's gone into 'vulshuns, and I want the boss to come right out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's gone into the country, and won't be back before night,&rdquo; replied I.
      &ldquo;Did your boy's arm bleed much?&rdquo;&mdash;not reflecting on the absurdity of
      a man biting a boy's arm off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bleed! Yes, all three stumps bled like a stuck deer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three h&mdash;lls! Spiffle, you're drunk! How could you bite off three of
      his arms?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, doctor! I meant his fingers; he put them in my mouth when I war
      asleep. Sens the old man's out, doctor, you must go. Jes' save his life,
      doc, and you'll never want vensun or a good trout-hole while I'm in the
      swamp! Be in a hurry, that's a good fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The chance was too good to be lost&mdash;a surgical and medical case
      combined&mdash;amputation and convulsions. What could be more opportune?
    </p>
    <p>
      Telling Spiffle I would go as soon as I got some medicine suitable to the
      case, I put near half a peck of valerian in my coat pockets, and an ounce
      vial of prussic acid in my vest; some calomel, assafoetida, lint, and
      adhesive plaster, completed my preparations, and I was ready for business.
      The horse I intended to ride was a favourite one of the old doctor's, but
      one which, accomplished equestrian as he was, he dare not back, except
      when the visit lay over some old beaten road; and as for riding him
      through the devious path of the swamp&mdash;one moment on the horse's neck
      to 'scape an impending limb, the next with the body at a right angle, to
      avoid a gnarled and thorny tree&mdash;now on one side, now on the other,
      and again on both&mdash;wading the backwater, jumping logs, swimming the
      dark and sullen slough, or with feet raised to the pommel to clear the
      cypress-knees, which on every side, as the path would cross a brake,
      obtruded their keen points, ready to impale the luckless wight who there
      might chance to lose his seat; to ride &ldquo;Chaos&rdquo; midst such paths as these,
      the old doctor, I have said, would never have dreamed of doing, and, most
      assuredly, had he been at home, would not have allowed me to undertake;
      but such a ride, with its break-neck peril, chimed well with my youthful
      feelings, which pursued the same reckless course that the heart's current
      of the medical student has run in, from the time when &ldquo;Chiron&rdquo; was a
      &ldquo;grave rat,&rdquo; to the Tyro of yesterday, who is looking in the dictionary
      for the meaning of &ldquo;artery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With all the seriousness naturally to be elicited by a responsible
      mission, I mounted Chaos, and started at a speed that beplastered the
      skeleton houses 011 each side of the way with mud, heaving a delectable
      morsel, as I passed the &ldquo;doggery,&rdquo; full in the mouth of a picayune
      demagogue, who, viewing the political sky with open mouth, was
      vociferating vehemently on the merits of his side. &ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; for he had
      just ejaculated, when the substance, which perhaps assisted in composing
      an antediluvian megathaslopsyolamagosogiam, or, possibly, &ldquo;imperial
      Cæsar,&rdquo; hit him &ldquo;vim&rdquo; in the patent orifice. Cleaning his throat, he
      spluttered out, &ldquo;Cuss the country, when a man can't holler for the feller
      that he likes best, but the heels of every 'prentice saw-bone's horse must
      fling clay in his teeth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Chaos heeded him not; imagining I was for a jaunt over his usual road,
      he gave way to only sufficient movement to indicate his mettle; but when
      the end of the street was reached, where the roads diverged, one pursuing
      its upward course over the towering hills&mdash;the first from its source
      that steal down to gaze upon the wavelets of the &ldquo;dark Yazoo&rdquo;&mdash;the
      other unobtrusively stealing its way a few hundred yards, and then
      yielding its being 'neath the placid waters of a bright-eyed lake. Seeing
      me turn to the latter, the noble horse gave a joyous neigh, and seemed to
      be imbued with a new life as he viewed the waters stretching far away into
      the forest, until wave and leaf were melted into one; and as he thought of
      the wild luxuriance of a hidden dell, gemmed with a glistening spring, the
      memory of which came floating up, fraught with the enjoyments of a month's
      pleasure the year gone by, when, disdaining the stable, he had sought the
      forest, and there, cropping the herbage, and roaming in all the wild
      luxuriance of freedom, forgot he was a slave, until the insidious wiles of
      Spiffle restored him to his owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oblivious, apparently, of my weight, he sprung into the waters, and soon&mdash;dashing
      his beautiful head until the spray covered me with delicious coolness&mdash;breasted
      the sleepy lake; and when his feet struck the firm ground, like the fawn
      from the hunters, away he sprang up the narrow path, which pursued its
      tortuous way like a monstrous snake, amidst the nodding grass and fragrant
      spice-wood, and old trees, fantastically interweaving their limbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      But little cared my courser for those old trees, clothed with moss, with
      the shadows of their arching boughs the pathway thrown across; he heeded
      not the verdancy beneath the eye displayed, nor the gorgeous summer
      mingling of the sunshine and the shade; the gentle voice of Eolus, as
      dallying with the grove, came breathing gentle symphonies, but not on him
      it wove the spell of soothing, subdued thought, such as the feelings
      haunt, when its tones renew the memory of a long-forgotten chant. With eye
      of dazzling brightness, with foam upon the breast, with mane back
      flaunting on the air, and proud erected crest; with champing bit, and
      eager bound, and earth-disdaining tread, and air, as if o'er battle-fields
      victoriously he sped. Soho! Soft, Chaos! Quiet! Soho!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which way now, Spiffle?&rdquo; said I, as the path appeared to cease at a
      clear, deep, narrow &ldquo;slough,&rdquo; full of cypress &ldquo;knees,&rdquo; which did not come
      to the surface, but seemed some few inches under.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right across,&rdquo; was the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! through those shoots? Why there's not room enough between them for
      a dog to swim, let alone a horse,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd be mighty out of breath 'fore you got through with the job, doc, if
      you tried to swim 'tween them, seein' as thar ten foot under. I war fooled
      here myself for mor'n a year; I'd take a 'bee' for home, an' come to this
      slew, an' then have to head it, on 'count of the neas; 'till one day I got
      on a 'bust' in town, an' my critter got loose and struck for home. I tract
      him up to whar we is, and here they stopt&mdash;the trax and me I mean;
      but on t'other side I seed them, and I knowed he must have swum. I war
      clean bothered to know how he got over without leaving some of his innards
      on the neas,&mdash;so I tuck a stick and puncht at one of them that war
      near outen the water, to see if it war a real cypress nubbin. I missed it
      clear, and kerchunk I went head foremost 'mongst their sharp points. Oh,
      my 'viscera!' I yelled; but I'll be cust if I toch a nea; they war ten
      foot under, and thar they stay, and thar they 'tend stayin', for they
      ain't grown a lick sens that time, and that war so long ago, that the next
      day I seed the fust steamboat that kum up the Yazoo skare an old buck to
      death, makin' him jump so fast that he sprung plum through his skull, and
      the last I seed of him, as he floated down the river, his head had hung on
      his lines, and one ear on each horn war fluttering his dying elegy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By the time this veracious anecdote was over, we had crossed the slough,
      and a ride of a few miles brought us to the cabin of my patron, who, now
      elevated with whiskey, had lost his paternal solicitude, and giving way to
      the garrulity of the drunkard, was making revelations concerning his past
      history, which, if true, and he had his dues, would have swung him higher
      than &ldquo;Barn Poker,&rdquo; of Coahoma, when the regulators were out.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found my patient doing very well, Mrs. Spiffle having sent, before my
      arrival, for one of those knowing old dames who match &ldquo;'sperience agin
      book larnin',&rdquo; and detract so considerably from the physician's income.
      The old lady, fortunately for the boy, had had sufficient knowledge of
      surgery to replace the fingers and apply bandages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether it was my naturally prepossessing phiz, or my ready acquiescence
      in the correctness of her treatment, that softened the old dame, I know
      not; but she appeared to take to me monstrously; and, after having had her
      mind satisfied as to my name, natality, and genealogy, she reciprocated
      intelligence, and, untying the scrap-bag of memory, proceeded to make a
      patch-quilt for me, of a case that resembled the one we were ministering
      to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Short arter I had kum from Georgy to Mass-ass-sip, a nere nabur&mdash;Miss
      Splicer&mdash;had a darter&mdash;Miss Spiffle, you had better gin Boney
      another sup of the sheep safurn&mdash;doctor, you said you had no
      injections to it&mdash;what made a slide one day, and 'lowed her dad's axe
      to fall on her foot, cutting her big toe clean off as sarcumstances would
      permit. It bled 'mazinly, and the gal hollered out till her mammy, who war
      splittin'&mdash;his throat, Miss Spiffle, a spoonful at a time&mdash;rails
      at the far end of the clearin' (for she was a monstrous 'dustryus woman,
      Miss Splicer was), heard the rumption and came to the house, lumbrin' over
      the high logs like a big bull in&mdash;a little more whiskey in mine, Miss
      Spiffle, if you please; what a pity it is that your husband drinks&mdash;a
      small pastur' in the worst of flytime, as she told me arter, thinking some
      of the town-boys had got hold of the gal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When she got there and seed the blood, and the toe excavated off,
      a-trying to keep time with the stump which war quiverin' in the air, like
      the gal had the 'skitters,' she memorized what a doctor had told her to do
      in such cases&mdash;to displace the parts and heal them up by the fust
      contention; so she slapt the toe on the foot agin, an' tide a rag on
      tight, an' put the gal to bed. Well, everything went on monstrous nice&mdash;scat!
      Miss Spiffle, the laws-a'-massy! that cat's tail come mity nigh toching
      his hand; and 'twould never got well&mdash;an' in 'bout two weaks, Miss
      Splicer axed me to come over and sister her getting the rag off, as she
      hadn't been informed that far, for her husband had got drunk and run the
      doctor off jist arter he had showed her how to put the thing up for
      healin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I went over, and arter soaking her&mdash;stumak, Miss Spiffle, put
      the goose grease on his stumak&mdash;foot in hot water, I peeled the rag
      off; and the Lord be marsiful to a sinful world, fur I seed the toe had
      grown fust-rate fast, but the poor ignerant creetur of a mother had put it
      on with the <i>nail turned down</i>, and the poor gal's dancing were
      'ternally spiled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Telling the people that I would not return unless they sent for me, and
      the sun being low, I mounted my horse and dashed off for home. Coming to a
      fork in the path, I took the one I thought I had come in the morning, and
      gave myself no further concern about the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      I mentioned that I had filled my pockets with Valerian on leaving home,
      and on this simple thing depended two lives, as the sequel will show.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a root, when fresh, of a powerful and penetrating odour peculiar to
      its species; permeable things, by remaining in contact with it, become
      imbued with its characteristic odour, which they retain for a considerable
      length of time. The root possesses great attraction for the cat tribe, who
      smell it at a great distance, and resort to it eagerly, devouring its
      fragrant fibres with great apparent relish. The panther of our continent
      is closely allied to the domestic cat, susceptible, like it, of taming,
      active, treacherous, and cunning,&mdash;only in proportion to its
      increased size, resembling it in its tastes, and like it, fearless when
      aroused by appetite or hunger.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had proceeded some distance, when it began to appear to me that the path
      I was travelling was not the one by which I had come in the morning, but
      as it was some miles back to the fork, and as far as I could judge, I
      seemed to be going in the right direction, I determined to proceed. So,
      cheering myself with a song, I tried to banish disagreeable reflections,
      and persuade myself that some recognised object would soon assure me I was
      in the right track.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now near sunset, and, in despite of my endeavours to the contrary,
      I was becoming somewhat anxious, as a gloom was already settling over the
      swamp, when, to my joy, I found myself upon the bayou or slough, whose
      illusory appearance I have noted. Not remarking that the path, instead of
      crossing, turned up the bank, I gave my horse the rein and he sprang into
      the stream; but what was my dismay, when I found, by the struggling of my
      poor steed for releasement, that I was mistaken in the slough, and that in
      this instance, the proximity of the &ldquo;knees&rdquo; to the surface was no
      illusion. He had fortunately become wedged between two of the largest,
      which sustained his weight, and saved him from being impaled upon those
      beneath. I had nothing in the shape of a cutting instrument, except a
      small penknife, which, under the circumstances, could afford me no aid.
      Dismounting in the water, by main strength I released my horse, and, as
      the sun withdrew its last lingering ray from the topmost boughs of the
      trees&mdash;jaded, wet, and exhausted&mdash;we stood in the midst of the
      swamp, on the banks of an unknown' slough, without food, fire, or weapon&mdash;lost!
      lost! lost! I could form no idea where I was, and go as I would, it would
      be hap-hazard if I went right, and the probabilities were that I would
      have to spend the night in the drearisome place.
    </p>
    <p>
      I soon discovered that it was losing time and gaining nothing to stand
      there. So I determined, as I was mightily down in the mouth, my course
      should accord with my feelings, so down the slough I started.
    </p>
    <p>
      The land, as far as I could see, was uniform low swamp, subject to the
      annual inundations of the Mississippi. The height to which the waters
      usually attained was several feet above my head on horseback, which made
      it more favourable to me, as the frequent submergings had in a great
      measure destroyed the undergrowth, and thus facilitated passing between
      the trees. I would not have cared for the night jaunt, had I only known
      where I was, and whither I was going; but the uncertainty made my feelings
      very disagreeable, and I mentally vowed that if I got home that once,
      Spiffle, Sen., might chaw up Spiffle, Jun., inch by inch, before I would
      come out to stop it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sped on as fast as I dared, the darkness growing profound, and my
      anxiety&mdash;I will not say fear&mdash;increasing every moment. An
      unusual stillness rested over the swamp, unbroken save by the tramp of my
      horse; not even a frog or chichado was to be heard, and the wind had
      assumed that low, plaintive wail amidst the leaves, that never fails to
      cast a melancholy shadow over the heart, and awaken all the superstitions
      of our minds. I was musing over the sad fate of an intimate friend who had
      recently come to an untimely death, and reflecting how hard it was that so
      much youthful ambition should perish, such a glorious sun go down shrouded
      with darkness whilst it yet was day, when the ominous silence was broken
      by a sound which, God grant, I may never hear again. Like a woman's
      shriek, in the damning anguish of desertion and despair&mdash;lost and
      ruined&mdash;was the long, piercing scream of the <i>Panther</i>, whose
      awful yell palsied my heart, and curdled the blood within my smallest
      veins. Again and again it arose, filling the solemn aisles of the darksome
      swamp, till echo took up the fearful sound, and every tree, bush, and
      brake, gave back the hellish, agonizing shriek.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was evidently approaching us; my poor horse trembled like an aspen
      beneath me, and seemed incapable of moving. Again, still nearer&mdash;the
      fierce and harrowing scream fell on my shrinking ear; and I knew the
      animal was upon my trail. Shaking off the lethargy into which I was fast
      sinking, I struck my horse, and, twining my hands in his mane, lay down on
      his neck, letting him go as he wished, as I did not know which way to
      guide him. With a snort of terror he sprung off with a speed that seemed
      miraculous, through the darkness and trees. I flattered myself that the
      rate at which we went would soon distance the panther; when, God of
      heaven! it arose more piercing and shrill, still nearer than before. I
      began to despair, as I had no weapon, save the pen-knife; and the animal,
      I knew, was one of the fiercest nature&mdash;else why did he follow for my
      blood? (I never thought of the <i>valerian.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      The speed of my horse, with the fearfulness of my situation, made me half
      delirious, and my thoughts began to wander&mdash;colours of all hues,
      shapes, arabesque and fantastical, danced before my eyes. I imagined that
      I was in the midst of a well-contested battle, and in the wavering fight,
      and covering smoke, and turmoil of the scene, I caught the emblem
      emblazoned on the banner of my foe, and it was a panther <i>couchant</i>.
      Making an effort to draw my sword, my hand came in contact with the vial
      of prussic acid in my vest pocket with considerable force. This aroused
      me; and, taking it out, I determined to commit suicide, should the panther
      overtake me&mdash;preferring to die thus, to being devoured alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again and again the awful scream of the infuriated animal arose, and fell
      like the weight of a mountain on my trembling frame. Nobly my gallant
      horse strove to save me; he required not the whip or spur; I gave him a
      word of encouragement, and the animal,&mdash;which we term a brute,&mdash;returned
      a low, whining neigh, as if he wished me to understand that he knew my
      danger, and would do all in his power. I looked up as the horse suddenly
      increased his speed, and found, to my delight, that we were in the right
      track; I imagined I could almost see the lights in the windows&mdash;but
      this I knew could not be. It was pleasant, however, to think that I was
      going home, and that if my horse could only keep ahead a few miles
      further, we would be safe; when&mdash;hist!&mdash;ha! ha! was it not
      enough to raise the laugh? I heard the scream of the panther not two
      hundred yards behind, and could almost hear his feet as they struck the
      ground after his leaps. He seemed to be rejoicing over his approaching
      feast&mdash;his screams arose fiercer&mdash;shriller&mdash;more horrid
      than before. The heavens gave back the sound&mdash;it was caught by every
      breeze&mdash;echoed from every dell; a hundred discordant voices joined in
      the infernal melody, while the loud neigh of my horse, as if for help,
      framed itself into a panther's shriek. I strove to breathe a prayer; but
      my parched tongue clove to the roof of my mouth, and what I uttered served
      but to add to the damning chorus of hellish sounds. I tore the neck of my
      poor horse with my teeth, to incite him to greater speed; but my time had
      come. Again I heard the panther's scream, so near that it pierced my brain
      with its acuteness.. I heard his spring, as he threw himself over the
      lowermost boughs of the trees, and shrank within myself, momentarily
      expecting him to alight, with his sharp teeth in my heart. The thought
      occurred to me, as, looking ahead, I really beheld the town lights
      glimmering&mdash;if I kill my horse, may not the panther be satisfied with
      <i>his</i> blood, and allow me to escape? There was reason in it; and,
      though a pang shot through me as I thought of sacrificing the noble animal
      who had borne me on thus far, yet the love of life overcame all scruples.
      With my penknife I felt carefully for the carotid artery, and, when it was
      found, plunged the blade in, inflicting a small but deadly gash. Giving a
      terrible spring, the hot blood gushing all over me, he ran as none but a
      noble horse, in the agonies of death, can run, and then, with a low,
      reproachful moan, fell dead; whilst I, disengaging myself, at a full run
      strove to make my escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      I heard the yell of the panther as he reached the horse, and as he stopped
      I thought myself safe; but not so long: for again his fierce scream came
      ringing o'er the air, and I was too well aware of the habits of the animal
      not to know that when the quarry is being devoured, their voice is still.
      Suicide by poison, or a more awful death, were all that was now left me. I
      heard the rapid leap of the panther, yelling at every spring. I uncorked
      the vial, and was raising it to my lips, when, as if by inspiration, came
      the blessed thought, that when the panther seized me, to pour the
      instantaneous poison down his throat. I uttered a low, deep prayer to God,
      and for one, who, if she had known my peril, would have sought to die with
      me, and then bracing myself firmly against a tree, with the vial clenched
      in my right hand, awaited the deadly foe. I heard his shriek, saw a huge
      form flying through the darkness, felt a keen pang in my shoulder, and
      then, pouring the acid in the mouth of the panther, fainted.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I recovered consciousness the moon was shining in my upturned face,
      and the huge form of the dead panther was lying by my side, <i>with the
      pocket holding the valerian firmly clenched in his teeth</i>.

    <h2>
      SEEKING A LOCATION
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was my
      intention, after graduating, to return and locate myself in the small town
      where I had studied my profession; but &ldquo;circumstances,&rdquo; which exerted such
      a powerful influence over a late unsuccessful aspirant for political
      honours, exercised a like power upon me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The death of my preceptor, whilst I was absent attending my last course of
      lectures, left a vacancy in the profession at home, which was speedily
      filled, as far as numbers went, by a horde of new-comers. So I found I
      would have to encounter, if I settled there, a greater competition,
      without the assistance I calculated deriving from him, than my slender
      means and already embarrassed finances qualified me to meet. Besides,
      locating among those who had known me from boyhood, the probation I would
      have to undergo before I secured their full confidence would be more
      severe, and of much longer duration, than if I had landed in their midst a
      perfect stranger. The transition from the boy to the man, and from the
      mischievous student to the grave, serious physician, is so gradual and
      imperceptible, that our old and intimate acquaintances do not realize it;
      and when they should know us as doctor they still give us our youthful
      appellatives, and regard us as boys. When I landed at home, proud of my
      new-fledged honours and &ldquo;sheepskin&rdquo; as a young mother of her first babe, I
      had, on meeting my former acquaintances, to fling my memory back to the
      eventful examining period to convince myself that I was really a &ldquo;doctor
      of medicine;&rdquo; for every one, even down to the children, called me
      &ldquo;Madison&rdquo; as before, and none of them seemed a moment to consider that a
      title, the acquisition of which had cost&mdash;both mental and pecuniary&mdash;as
      much as mine, should be occasionally used.
    </p>
    <p>
      In despite of these disadvantageous circumstances, and my own
      disinclination, it was the opinion of some few friends, to whom I deferred
      greatly, that I had better locate there; so procuring an office, and
      having my name and title emblazoned on a sheet of tin, which I securely
      fastened to the door, I shook off gaiety and the dust of my feet at the
      lintel, and with a ponderous tome, and anatomically painted skull before
      me, took my seat at my small green baize coloured table, to await cases
      and patients.
    </p>
    <p>
      I recollect distinctly, as no doubt every young professional man does in
      his own case, my sensations upon the first few days succeeding the setting
      of my trap, when I was constantly upon the look-out for some victim
      approaching the bait.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried to address myself to the volume before me, but my busy imagination
      had turned architect, and was erecting air-built tenements of the most
      magnificent and gorgeous nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Calls&rdquo; innumerable flitted through my brain. Fevers, from simple
      intermittents to congestive, were awaiting my curative dispensations;
      whilst a trumpeter stood ready to peal forth my triumphs to the world, and
      a quiet, unobtrusive grave, to cover the unsuccessful.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had just performed a surgical operation, never before attempted, of the
      most difficult and dangerous character, upon the &ldquo;President,&rdquo; with the
      happiest results. The medical world was ringing with my name; and even the
      trading community, partaking of the general enthusiasm, mingled me in
      their thoughts, and spoke of my wonderful scientific achievements in the
      same breath that told of the rise or decline of stocks, and a slight
      improvement in the price of cotton. And the ladies, too&mdash;God bless
      them! that their approving smiles sow the seeds of ambition in many
      hearts; ay, even the soft, tender-lipped lady, made me a theme of
      conversation, when her daily allowance of characters had been torn to
      pieces, and scandal palled the tongue. Edinburgh and London were striving
      which should obtain my services, as professor in one of their
      world-renowned institutions; and the crown was moving from the brows of
      Esculapius to my own; when&mdash;hark! &ldquo;'Tis the cathedral pealing my
      triumphs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen how the solemn chant comes pouring up the mysterious aisle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw! 'tis the supper-bell, a little negro ringing 'Jim along Josey.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I wrapped my cloak around me as if to shut out all the world, and strode
      off moodily to my supper, mad at myself for having yielded to my fancy,
      and almost allowing it to lead me astray.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day passed without a call&mdash;six days died of marasmus, and never
      the first patient crossed the threshold of my office. I could see other
      physicians hurrying by, attending to their numerous calls; some of them as
      youthful as myself; but, happily for them, they had the impress of the
      exotic, whilst I was indigenous to the soil. I sat in my lonely office,
      and could hear, as the busy noises of the town died away, and night
      allowed care to come on the face, which, through the garish day, had
      striven to appear mirthful, the hurried step of the messenger from the
      sick; but they never stopped at my door&mdash;but on, on by, till distance
      had eaten up their clanging tread. Mine is a temperament which, exalted to
      almost delirium one moment, sinks into proportionate depression the next;
      and even the short space of a week without employment made me
      down-hearted, and assailed me with continual despondency. My debts,
      contracted through the long years I had devoted to my profession&mdash;for
      malicious tongues had estranged my preceptor almost from me before his
      death, and determined me to repay him for all his pecuniary expenditures&mdash;knocked
      continually against the door of my honour, and often, as I heard the saw
      and hammer of the artisan ringing through the town, I almost cursed the
      mistaken kindness of my friends, which had made a professional man of me,
      and wished, like the mechanic, I could go forth and earn my sweet and
      honest bread by the hot sweat of my brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      By chance I learned that a good location for a young physician presented
      itself in the Louisiana swamps. To resolve to seek it, to communicate my
      resolution to my friends, to obtain the necessary letters of introduction,
      and take passage on a steamer bound for Vicksburg, where I would have to
      reship, was the work of a few hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      The contemplated location was a short distance in the interior of the
      parish of Madison, and my next destination after arriving at V&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      would be Milliken's Bend, where I could obtain a horse and explore the
      country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just at sunrise, a steamer of rather slender dimensions and shabby
      appearance, came creeping along to V&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it was the first upward-bound boat that had arrived, a crowd of
      passengers, who were there awaiting one, rushed on board to secure a
      passage, myself among the number. Ascertaining how long she intended
      remaining there, which was but a short time, I thought I would have time
      to go up town and purchase some articles which I required, and had nearly
      forgotten; I procured them, and heard, as I descended the levee, the boat
      ringing her last bell; hastening my steps, I jumped on board just as she
      was pushing out. On going up in the cabin, I found to my surprise that I
      was the only passenger. She had brought none to Vicksburg, and of all the
      crowd who rushed on there, none had remained save myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a mystery about the thing that I could not fathom, and did not
      endeavour very hard to penetrate; for my future was a sufficiently
      impenetrable enigma to employ all my penetration. Attributing the absence
      of passengers to the poor accommodations that were visible, I gave myself
      no further thought about the matter, but taking my cigar, ascended to the
      hurricane-deck, and there seating myself, gazed abstractedly out upon the
      waters, and gave myself up to my reflections. They were of a mixed nature;
      joy and sorrow, pride and shame, struggling for the mastery through all my
      recollections, and making too many compromises with each other for a
      spirit that strove to be at peace with, itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, in the same bold, impetuous torrent, coursed the majestic &ldquo;Father
      of Waters,&rdquo; as it did ten long years ago, when the doctor, who was
      ascending it, seeking for a home amidst strangers&mdash;his heart
      care-worn and filled with anxiety, descended its current&mdash;a scullion.
    </p>
    <p>
      My pride was gratified to think that I had risen as it were superior to my
      station and opportunities, and, from a scullion, had become a member of an
      honourable profession; and that, too, ere the beard had come on my face,
      or years twenty-one stamped me a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were within two miles of the &ldquo;Bend&rdquo; when, as I descended from the upper
      deck, being partly hidden by the wheel-house, I heard one of the officers
      remark to the captain', in a laughing tone, &ldquo;I wonder if that young fellow
      up on the deck there, would smoke his cigar so unconcernedly if he only
      knew he was seated over twenty thousand kegs of powder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I almost slipped overboard in my surprise. Twenty thousand kegs of powder!
      Jehovah! how much of Madison Tensas, M. D., would be left, I wonder, after
      that quantity of explosive material had ignited under him? One of the
      finest instances on record of molecular disintegration would be presented,
      I expect. This explains why the passengers left so summarily. &ldquo;I must get
      out of this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I will go ashore, captain; there is where I want to land,&rdquo;
       pointing to a house at least two miles below the &ldquo;Stores.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boat landed; and, after getting ashore, I did not cease running until
      I got considerable space and a large tree between her and myself. The
      crew, suspecting from my movements that I had discovered the nature of
      their cargo, gave vent to a hearty peal of laughter, with which sounding
      in my ears, I gained the high-road. And this was my first introduction to
      the state of my future adoption.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having a letter of introduction for the principal physician in the &ldquo;Bend,&rdquo;
       I slung my saddle-bags over my shoulder, and trudged along through the mud
      to his house, the direction of which I obtained from a passer-by.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon presenting my letter to Doctor J&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, I was
      received with as much kindness and consideration as if I had been a
      magnate of the land, rolling up in my carriage and four, instead of a poor
      young doctor, saddle-bags on shoulder, seeking a home in the swamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thine was a good, kind welcome, Doctor Tom, and the &ldquo;Swamp Doctor,&rdquo; I
      assure you, often recurs to it with pleasure. Thine was the first
      stranger's hand, in my adopted state, that I pressed, and found, ere it
      had unclasped its pressure, that I held, a friend's. Thine was the first
      roof in this land of hospitable homes that sheltered me; and oh! thy hands
      compounded the first <i>julep</i> which for long, long months had
      ecstasied my lips, thou hast to answer to old D&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;e for
      the apostacy of one of his chosen disciples; and though I have felt
      contrition for the fall, yet I forgive thee, Doctor Tom, cheerfully I
      forgive thee. Would that one sat before me now, as I write in my lonely
      bachelor den, the skies obscured with darkness, the rain pattering against
      the casement, the single bed looking so cold, so cold, and the December
      blast whistling through the chinks of the logs; would that I had one now!
      winter as it is, though it were heaped with ice, if it came from thy
      hands, thy warmth of heart would impart to it some of its cordial fire,
      and kindle up a genial glow within my frame. Though I were thrice a Son of
      Temperance, I could not refrain from a julep of thy mixing, and though my
      lips might murmur, my heart would not dictate, &ldquo;Deliver me from
      temptation.&rdquo; Oh! what a glorious barkeeper was spoiled when they made you
      a doctor, Doctor Tom!
    </p>
    <p>
      After partaking of a cold snack, it not yet being the dinner-hour, mounted
      on a horse which the doctor loaned me, I obtained the necessary
      directions, and turning my back on the Mississippi river, struck into the
      interior, in search of the contemplated location.
    </p>
    <p>
      The settlement to which I was destined, was situated on a small river
      which, singular to relate, as I had never heard of any member of my family
      having ever lived there, bore the same name as myself, being called the
      &ldquo;Tensas.&rdquo; Looking upon this coincidence of names as a good omen, an
      assurance at least that I would meet one acquaintance or kinsman there, I
      surrendered my mind to a renewal of my day-dreams of future professional
      success and distinction, and disregarding a proper notice of the road,
      suddenly awakened and found myself lost&mdash;the road having given out in
      a cypress brake.
    </p>
    <p>
      To resolve to return was one thing, to do it another, for the timber roads
      so crossed and interlaced each other that I frequently found myself
      returning to the same point in the &ldquo;brake&rdquo; from whence I started. Well,
      thought I, I hope my future lot will be a verification of the old adage,
      that a &ldquo;bad beginning makes a good ending,&rdquo; for mine is bad enough. I
      wandered about several hours, occasionally dismounting to assist my horse
      out of some slough wherein he had bogged, and was about to give it up as a
      bad job, when I had the good fortune to find a road, which, being over
      knee-deep in mud, and dotted with the bones of deceased oxen, I judged to
      be the main highway, which conjecture I soon verified on meeting a
      traveller. After proceeding a few miles I reached Eagle Lake, which it was
      necessary to cross in a shallow ferry flat. Here an accident occurred,
      which came near preventing these pages from ever being written. The
      current was running very strongly from a small bayou into the lake, and as
      we approached the shore, suddenly striking the flat, it impelled it with
      considerable force against a tree, which the high water had submerged for
      ten or twelve feet. I was standing in the bow of the flat, holding my
      horse by the rein, and the shock nearly prostrated us both. Before I could
      recover, the horse plunged overboard. I would have been dragged with him
      to almost certain death, as I could not swim, had not the ferry-man caught
      me, and released my arm from the rein. The steed swam to shore; and after
      a short time suffered himself to be mounted. Matters, so far, I must
      confess, had not impressed me very favourably with the country&mdash;first
      to be lost in a cypress brake, and then my life placed in jeopardy, looked
      rather like discouraging treatment; but I had determined to bear up
      against everything, and if these were the heaviest misfortunes I had to
      encounter, to laugh at care.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as the sun was setting I reached the &ldquo;Tensas,&rdquo; striking it at the
      &ldquo;point,&rdquo; to the owner of which, Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, I had a
      letter of introduction. He received me very hospitably, and was profuse in
      his offers of assistance, both by employing me himself, and favourably
      recommending me to his friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night passed off, and the next morning Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; and
      myself started to visit the other families to whom I had letters of
      introduction and recommendation; not two hundred yards from the house, it
      became necessary to cross what was called the &ldquo;Island shoot.&rdquo; The current
      was running swiftly, and it was nearly swimming. My companion, better
      acquainted with the passage, forded it safely; but in following, my steed
      got astride of a submerged log, and down we both went, head and ears,
      under the muddy waters. I determined, if possible, not to dissolve the
      union between horse and rider, and therefore held on to him, and at length
      he scrambled out. I was thoroughly drenched, but I knew at the outset it
      would never do to appear to mind such an accident before an &ldquo;old swamper,&rdquo;
       like Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, and therefore joined him in his hearty
      laugh at the dolesome plight of myself and horse. To make the matter
      worse, I had only the suit of clothes I wore along, and was constrained to
      borrow a change of apparel. I am above the average size, and both Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      and his overseer were considerably under; so a proper appreciation can be
      had of the nature of the fit. Laying off my cloth, I donned a suit of
      &ldquo;swamp broad-cloth,&rdquo;&mdash;yellow linsey&mdash;which clove to my
      proportions as if it were an integral portion of my frame. This time we
      had better luck crossing the &ldquo;shoot,&rdquo; and after spending the day, visiting
      the neighbours, and making arrangements for securing the practice, we
      returned to the &ldquo;point.&rdquo; My unique appearance created a good deal of mirth
      and remark during the day; but as I laughed with the loudest, ridicule was
      soon despoiled of his shaft, and my indifference at what would have
      affected the majority of young men, very sensibly raised me
      proportionately high in the opinion of the &ldquo;swampers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The encouragement I had received, I thought sufficient to warrant me in
      locating there; so the next morning I started, on my return, to procure a
      horse, and have my books and medicines brought to my new home. The
      settlement I designed locating in, was a very new one, the majority of the
      residents holding their lands merely by pre-emption claims, little of the
      country having been offered for sale by &ldquo;Uncle Sam.&rdquo; There was but one
      frame house in the whole settlement, the dwellings with that exception
      being composed of logs, some with the bark yet on them, others of split
      trees, whilst a few, by their squared appearance, gave evidence of the
      broad-axe, and a greater degree of refinement in their occupants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately for me, as I thought at the outset, but unhappily, as the
      sequel proved, the most influential, or rather the most numerous portion
      of the settlers of my destined locality, were all of one family, or
      otherwise closely connected. Being originally from Virginia, they had all
      the proverbial clannishness of that highly favoured race, and the mortal
      upon whom one of the &ldquo;set&rdquo; smiled was immediately sneezed upon with favour
      by the rest. They all eat with the same tastes, and used the same pair of
      spectacles to view men and measures. They were a hardy, vigorous,
      industrious set, and, divested of their foolish clannishness,
      irreproachable. The first year, I was a small saviour with them; the
      second, having aroused the ire of one of them, the whole clan were as
      strenuous to break me down, as the year before they had been solicitous to
      advance my interests; but the &ldquo;Swamp Doctor&rdquo; had grown beyond their reach.
      But I anticipate, and must return.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lands were composed of rich alluvial, deposited by the turbid waters
      of the Mississippi, and protected by embankments termed &ldquo;levees,&rdquo;
       ungratefully thrown up to keep out the very cause to which the country
      owed its existence. Whenever the levees proved insufficient, or happened
      to break, chickens and garden-tools fell to a discount, and ducks and
      cat-hooks rose to a premium.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tillable land, varying in breadth from one hundred yards to several
      miles, lay upon the water-courses, which ramified the surface of the
      country, and formed, when swollen by rains or overflow, a perfect network
      of watery communications. The land between the tillable or cane ridges,
      was low swamp, almost quagmire, never thoroughly dry, and almost
      impassable nine months out of the year.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the height of summer the country appeared to a fair advantage,
      surpassing any in the world for producing the great southern staple; but
      at the time I first visited it, not expecting company, it had on almost
      its worst garb. The mud was nearly saddle-skirt deep in the roads, and the
      low lands utterly impassable.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought that never yet did country merit its name so well as it; the
      whole of the Louisiana bottoms being indiscriminately known as the
      &ldquo;swamp,&rdquo; and people, male and female, termed &ldquo;swampers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The appearance of the country would have disgusted and deterred many from
      settling, but it had the promise of being a sickly one, and highly
      suitable for a doctor&mdash;and such was the locality I sought; besides, I
      was certain of making a support, and to accomplish that, I would have
      submitted to any and all privations.
    </p>
    <p>
      I returned safely to the &ldquo;Bend,&rdquo; and being careful in my selection of a
      boat this time, to see that she had not a government contract for
      transporting powder, arrived at my former home, and commenced making
      preparations for a speedy return to my adopted &ldquo;swamp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a few days, I had concluded my arrangements, and without a sigh or a
      tear of regret turned my back on my student home, and sought my new
      location, which I reached without further adventure.

    <h2>
      CUPPING AN IRISHMAN.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>uring my last
      year's attendance on the lectures, I became the inmate, for the purpose of
      walking the wards, of a certain marine hospital, situated on a certain
      western river&mdash;of which Randolph has recorded his opinion&mdash;where
      the patients receive&mdash;paradoxical as it may seem&mdash;the kindest,
      yet the grossest treatment imaginable.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were four or five brother &ldquo;Rats&rdquo; besides myself residing in the
      hospital, all candidates for graduation, and consequently all desirous of
      obtaining sufficient medical lore to prevent us from being thrown higher
      at the &ldquo;ides of March.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Never before&mdash;at least by any of us&mdash;was such assiduity
      displayed; so much mental pabulum devoured; so many of the latent energies
      of studiousness called into play, as then. No case, however disgusting,
      was put in the objective; no symptom, however trivial, obscure, or
      mysterious, could pass unnoticed; and the proudest soar of the bird of
      Jove would have passed unheeded, had a sore of another description
      occurred coincidently. Fingers which the previous session had never been
      employed in higher surgery than forking a sleepy chum, or picking
      needlepoints out of a pretty seamstress's hand, now gracefully adapted the
      pliant bandage to the fractured limb, or drew the ruby with the lancet
      keen. No longer the sweet vision of midnight oyster-suppers illumined the
      mental horizon, obscured by the listening to of six long lectures daily.
      No longer at the &ldquo;wee short hours avant the twal&rdquo; was our Ganymede
      summoned to evoke the spirit of the whiskey jug. No longer musingly
      reclining did we watch the airy genii of the best cigar, borne up
      heavenward on the curling chariots of their consuming earthly tabernacles.
      No longer&mdash;pshaw! to comprise the whole, we were studying for our
      degrees, preparing for the opportunity of passing our opinion on the
      question, &ldquo;Whether the sheepskin of a young graduate, applied to his back,
      would be a contiguous or a continuous membrane?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Among the rest was Charley L&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, a young fellow of
      considerable talents&mdash;well aware, by the bye, of their possession&mdash;who
      having heard of my reputation for cupping, was not long in bantering me to
      a trial of skill, having some pretensions that way himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tensas,&rdquo; said he one night, when we had all assembled in the apothecary's
      shop of the establishment, to compare notes and discuss the day, &ldquo;do you
      think you could cup an Irishman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cup an Irishman!&rdquo; repeated I, &ldquo;yes, or a Dutchman, or an eel, or a buck
      running, or a streak of slow lightning, or anything that wears four square
      inches of skin. But why do you ask, Charley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I tried to-day, and it took me so long, and was not well done at
      that, that I got in late to old D&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'s lecture,
      and he looked as sour at me as if he had caught one of the vice presidents
      of the P. T. S., drinking something stronger than water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, just show your Irishman to me, and if I don't scarify and cup him
      in ten minutes I'll treat&mdash;that is, take notes for the whole crowd
      to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll give you half an hour, and you can't do it&mdash;scarify and put
      twelve tumblers on him. I'll bet you a box of cig&mdash;hem&mdash;give you
      choice of subjects at the next raising.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Done! when shall the trial come off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right off; everything is ready, Irishman and all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the medical ward at that time was an Irishman, evidently not long
      caught, whose greatest disease, from all external indications, was
      poverty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weather being very inclement, and the hospital having the reputation
      of keeping up good fires, and feeding its inmates pretty well, Pat took an
      idea into his head that he would lay up within its friendly walls during
      the severity of the winter; so going to the mayor of the city, whose
      benevolent heart never allowed him to refuse an applicant for the city's
      charities, he obtained by his piteous representations and obvious want, a
      hospital permit, and was, in consequence of it, soon snugly ensconced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having the faculty of bending one knee, so that no efforts could
      straighten the joint, he came in as a case of chronic rheumatism, and
      manfully the rascal stood the kind exertions to relieve him, so as to
      deceive the most experienced, and cause the putting of him down in the
      books as one of the &ldquo;incurables.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charley, however, having fine opportunities of investigating the case, had
      his suspicions aroused as to the reality of Pat's disease, and,
      determining to settle the matter, selected him as my cupping subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I believe Pat's shamming; suppose we tell him that old D&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      has directed him to be scarified and cupped, and Tensas can apply the
      remedy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agreed!&rdquo; said all with one voice. Filling a tray with tumblers and a
      bottle of alcohol, we proceeded in a body to the ward where the victim was
      placidly reposing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing us approach with all the apparatus for &ldquo;making a night of it,&rdquo; Pat
      imagined he was going to be put on a more stimulating course of treatment,
      and his eyes fairly glistened, and his leg was, if possible, drawn still
      more closely to his body as he took a mental view of his situation; no
      work, good lodgings, pleasant medicine, liberal diet, and at last, to cap
      the climax of his earthly felicity, the pure &ldquo;Crame of the Valley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, Pat, my boy, how do you rise to-night?&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, an' good troth, young docthurs, like Inglan's tare for the ould
      counthry's misry, I don't rise at all at all&mdash;not aven the laste bit;
      here is me stretched on me back like a nagur, unable to work for my
      praties, or a wee drap of the crathur, ochone! ochone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you improve any? Can't you walk a bit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shure, not a bit! How am I to travel when my fut is bent up to where a
      rich man's boot shakes hands with a puir man? ochone! Its 'frade I am I'll
      be always here, instid of warkin', an' drinkin', an' votin', an' bein' a
      fray-man, as me muther was to the fore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope not, Pat,&rdquo; said I, desirous of bringing the conversation to a
      close, &ldquo;old D&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; has directed me to cup you, and
      that is what has brought us up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cup me, is it? Well it's reddy I am&mdash;shure an' have been for the
      long time; make it strong with the whiskey; bless the ould man, I tould
      him the other day, when he was prachin' the could wather, that a good
      strong cup would cure me as well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Great was Pat's consternation when he found that the tumblers, from which
      arose the odoriferous scent of the alcohol, were to go on him, instead of
      their contents going in him. He would have demurred, but he saw the
      uselessness of the attempt, and therefore assented to the operation with
      rather a lank visage, I must confess.
    </p>
    <p>
      I soon repented the wager, and wished myself well rid of my bargain; the
      rascal had perfect command of the muscles of his brawny chest, and no
      sooner would a cup be exhausted and applied, than with a sudden
      contraction of the muscles, he would send it, with a simmering noise,
      rolling to the distant side of the bed. I tried every way, in the usual
      manner, to make them retain their hold, but the task was fruitless;
      occasionally one would flatter me it was going to remain, but scarcely
      could I give my attention to the other side, when off it would come. The
      half hour wanted but ten minutes of being out, and the cups were still
      unapplied. I became almost desperate, and called up two long-nailed
      Kentucky nurses, and made them hitch their fingers in the folds of the
      integuments on either side, so as to hold the muscles tense until the cups
      could adhere. This plan bid fair to answer, and the jeerings, remarks, and
      shouts of laughter, at my apparent discomfiture, which had greeted me in
      that unusual place for mirth, somewhat subsided; one minute of the
      allotted time was left, and but one cup remained unapplied. Up to this
      time, the steward of the hospital had been waiting upon me, pouring the
      alcohol, with which to exhaust the cup, from a tumbler nearly full into an
      empty glass, and then turning it out, he would hand it to me, and by the
      time it was applied have another ready; but one remained, as I have said,
      and I was waiting for it, when Charley, who had a finale for his test
      which none of us anticipated, suddenly substituted for the empty glass,
      the one nearly full of pure alcohol; suspecting no such trick, and there
      being no time for critical examination, I stuck the candle to it, and
      essayed as the blaze burst out, to apply it high up on the Irishman's
      breast. With a rushing, roaring sound, out burst the flaming liquid all
      over the poor devil's body.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a loud scream, amidst the roars of involuntary laughter which
      attended his advent, Patrick gave a spring nearly to the ceiling, and
      dashing like fragile reeds the sturdy men who were holding him to the
      floor, amidst the cries of fire! fire! curses in Irish, loud and long, and
      the crash of the shivering tumblers, as he shed himself of them, took
      refuge in a large bathing-tub full of water, which, fortunately for him,
      stood in the ward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shouts of fire alarmed the whole hospital, and here, pell-mell, came
      the patients to see where it was. Forms emaciated by consumption rustled
      against others distended by dropsy. Four forms lay mixed up in the hall,
      and all of them could only muster up two pairs of legs, a pair and a half
      of eyes, and four arms. It was as though a false alarm had been given by
      Gabriel, and only a partial resurrection had taken place.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one of the upper apartments was a private patient, labouring under the
      disease indifferently known as the blue-devils, red-monkeys, seeing
      injuns, or man-with-the-poker, or rather that mysterious individual had
      succeeded in overtaking his victim, and awful licks, to be sure, he was
      giving. His delirium was, that he was an alligator, and that there was a
      blood-thirsty minnow determined on taking his life at all hazards. Great
      were his struggles to preserve himself, requiring the constant presence of
      two keepers to restrain him from self-immolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hearing the shouts of fire from below, they, acting on the conservative
      principle, left their patient, and sought safety in flight, not long
      unfollowed by the drunkard, who proceeded down stairs, until he came to
      the ward from whence the shouts of laughter had not ceased to issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door being open, in he marched, presenting a fearful aspect&mdash;nearly
      naked, his eyes blood-shotten, and glaring with the light of delirium, his
      teeth clenched, with the lips drawn apart, a slight foam resting on them,
      blood dripping from a wound in his forehead, and brandishing a huge
      medical appurtenance, acting on the principle of the force-pump, and
      familiar to children on a small scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing Pat in the tub, the cynosure of all eyes, the man with the
      red-monkeys took an idea that he was the identical minnow aiming at the
      vitality of his alligatorship, and this would be a good opportunity of
      killing him off.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a loud yell, he sprung towards poor Pat, who, perfectly bewildered,
      let him get nearly on him, before he thought of getting out of the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hould him!&rdquo; he yelled, &ldquo;the crathur's gone clane out of his head! Holy
      jabers! hould him! He'll be afther the killin' me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But no one having time, or showing a disposition to interfere, he found he
      would have to bestir himself in his own behalf, and the biggest tracks,
      and the fastest, and the more of them, were made by the man who, previous
      to the time, had not moved a step for months. Through the long hall, down
      the double steps, out of the yard, and over the commons he went, yelling
      at every jump, whilst the &ldquo;man with the poker's&rdquo; friend, perfectly
      satisfied at the result, fish-like squatted down in the tub, and then
      quietly suffered himself to be led back to his room.

    <h2>
      BEING EXAMINED FOR MY DEGREE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">R</span>eader! have you
      ever taken a shower-bath of a cold winter's morning? or felt a snake
      crawling over you whilst in bed? or tried to sleep with a deadly fight
      awaiting you in the morning? or tried to unite the oil of your nature with
      the agua pura of a chattering damsel, and found no alkali to effect the
      union&mdash;in other words, popped the question and been&mdash;refused? or
      swallowed poison, and no stomach-pump about? or slept with a man with the
      small-pox? or tried to write, with a couple of gabbling widows in the next
      room? or run for a political office? or shook hands with the itch? or been
      without a friend or dollar, thousands of miles from home, and a catch-pole
      after you for your tavern bill? or had the toothache? or&mdash;think of
      the most uneasy, miserable melancholy, dolesome action, sensation,
      occurrence, or thought of your life. Read of nothing for two weeks but
      earthquakes, famines, bankruptcy, murders, suicides, and distress in its
      blackest form: work on your imagination until you feel yourself labouring
      under all these combined misfortunes, and perhaps then you may have a
      slight appreciation of how a young grave rat feels just before he is
      examined for his degree. Examined, too, by seven old dried-up specimens of
      humanity, who look as if they had descended for the occasion from some
      anatomical museum, and who have looked on death, suffering, and annual
      ranks of medical aspirants, until they have about as much softness of
      heart as the aforesaid preparations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first course of medical lectures the <i>student</i> attends, is
      generally distinguished by his devotion to everything but his studies. At
      the commencement of the lectures he purchases a blank-book, for the
      ostensible purpose of taking notes of the lectures; but unwittingly his
      fingers, instead of tracing the chirographical characters, are engaged in
      caricaturing the professor, who is endeavouring to beat into his and a few
      hundred kindred heads, the difference between a dirty Israelite and the
      'nasty moses of an artery. He devotes the midnight hour to dissecting&mdash;pigs-feet,
      grouse, and devilled bones, or the delicate structure of the epicurean
      oyster. He strengthens his voice by making the short hours of the
      night-clad street alive with the agreeable annunciation, especially to
      nervous invalids and sick children, that he &ldquo;will not go home till
      morning.&rdquo; He astonishes the professor of chemistry when lecturing upon
      electricity, by placing a few pounds of powder in communication with the
      machine, and blowing the laboratory to atoms, when the experiments are
      going on. He forms a pleasant surprise for his landlady by slipping into
      the dining-hall when the meats are on the table, and slyly inserting a
      dead baby, stolen from the dissecting-room, under the cover, in place of
      the abstracted pig, producing a pleasant sensation when discovered, and
      giving a good appetite to the boarders. He puts quick-lime into the young
      ladies' puff-box, and gives them a wash of lunar caustic to allay the
      irritation. He and the janitor go halves in raising game-cocks, and the
      expenses of a whole winter's lectures are often bet on a <i>main</i>.
      There is always some medical book that he wishes to purchase, of course
      very expensive&mdash;and to obtain which he is always writing home for
      money to parents or guardian. John Smith suffers, and always appears in
      the police reports, when the first course student is put in the
      watch-house, and let off by the kind-hearted mayor next morning, on paying
      fees and promising to amend. To sum up the whole, the first course, with
      few exceptions, conducts himself in such a manner, that but little
      injustice is done him when he is classed with free negroes, rowdies, and
      low-flung draymen. But the second course&mdash;phew! what a change comes
      over the fellow! You would think, to see him, that when he was born,
      gravity and soberness had given up the ghost, and their disembodied
      spirits found a carnal habitation in his cranium.
    </p>
    <p>
      He now endeavours, by unremitting attention, to retrieve lost time, and
      impress the professors favourably in his behalf, for he is now a candidate
      for graduation, and he dare not go home without his degree. His care-clad
      face is now seen on the foremost bench, listening with a painful
      absorption, and taking voluminous notes in a book&mdash;not the only thing
      bound in calf-skin in the room, by long odds&mdash;and always asks, with
      the utmost deference, long explanations on some favourite theory of the
      lecturer, so dazzlingly original, that he did not perfectly understand it,
      so bewildered was he by admiration. He smells of the dissecting-room, and
      takes occasion, when in the presence of the professor of anatomy, of
      jerking out his handkerchief, and with it the half cut up hand of a
      subject. He eschews tobacco, whiskey, and women, joins the physiological
      temperance society, and collects facts for a forthcoming work of the
      professor of practice. He is a strong vitalist with &ldquo;Old Charley,&rdquo; and
      lies-big with the Liebigian follower of acids and alkalies. He presents
      the pelvis of the female that obeyed the Lord's ordinance twenty-six times
      in ten years, to the professor of observations, and has a faculty of
      making himself generally useful to the whole faculty. I, to return to
      particularities, had followed after the manner of <i>first coursers</i>,
      and would have been a <i>fac simile</i> of the candidate, or second course
      student, had it not been for my habitual laziness, and perhaps an
      overweening confidence in my natural powers of impudence to push me
      through. I had had one or two fights the previous session, in the college,
      which brought me favourably, of course, before the notice of the faculty,
      as a quiet, studious gentleman, and removed all doubts from my mind of my
      having a safe and honourable passage. I held a high head, but was
      confoundedly frightened, and often wished that I were not an aspirant for
      the privilege of being a hired assassin, a slayer, without the victim
      having a chance to hit back. Many, I say, were my misgivings, as I saw the
      ides of March, the time for examination, approach, that my want of medical
      lore might knock me higher than the green baize of medicine could cluster&mdash;and
      yet, never was poor mortal better entitled to write M.D. after his name
      than I, miserable devil as I was. But fear would not keep back the evil
      day. The bell sounded for class T to go up and be examined, and away we
      went slowly, as to a summons for pistols and coffee for two, with feelings
      resembling those of a gambler who has staked his whole pile, and found at
      the <i>call</i> that he has been bluffing up against a <i>greenhorn with
      &ldquo;three white aces</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We were to be examined in separate rooms; our class, consisting of seven
      members, by as many professors, fifteen minutes being allotted to each
      professor in which to find out the qualifications of the candidate.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have already indicated the course I intended to pursue in my examination&mdash;impudence
      and assurance was a new method for a candidate, and might succeed
      where-the old plan would be nearly certain to fail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Entering boldly, without knocking, the room of one of the professors, who,
      being a superannuated widower, affected youthfulness very much, and prided
      himself very much, like a Durham stock raiser, on the beauty of his
      calves, to his dismay I found him arranging a pair of elaborate false
      ones, which showed a great disposition to work around to the front of his
      spindle-shanks. I had him dead for his vote, sure. I held the calves,
      whilst he adapted them to their places, and smoking a cigar during his
      fifteen minutes&mdash;he congratulated me upon the progress, he had often
      remarked, I was making in my studies, and at the expiration of his time,
      as he conducted me to the door, assured me he would vote for me, adding,
      &ldquo;by-the-bye, Tensas, you needn't mention anything about the calves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well! here's one vote, sure; would I had the other six as safe, thought I.
      &ldquo;Physiology, where are you? You are wanted!&rdquo; said I, as the door enclosed
      me with the professor of that branch, who, fortunately for me, was what is
      called a <i>vitalist</i>&mdash;sticking up for nature, and bitterly denied
      the Liebigian theory, which refers so many of the living phenomena to
      chemistry. He and the professor of chemistry were nearly at daggers'
      points upon the subject, and exceedingly excitable whenever it was
      mentioned in their presence. I knew my cue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take a seat, Mr. Zensas, you appear wondrous full of vivacity,&rdquo; said the
      professor, as I entered, singing &ldquo;A was an artery,&rdquo; &amp;c. &ldquo;Yes, sir, and
      I can assure you it is vivacity of the same kind that a beneficent Creator
      exhaled into the nostrils of the first-created&mdash;life in the sense in
      which every reasonable man&mdash;every man with a proper appreciation of
      the subject&mdash;every man of learning and intellect, and physiological
      acquisition, regards the vital principle&mdash;and not that degraded
      vitality of the Liebigian system, which makes man's assimilating functions
      a chemical operation, and degrades his mighty nature to the level of the
      ass&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;hideous doctrine,&rdquo; broke in the old professor. &ldquo;Mr. Tensas,
      would that the whole class possessed your discriminative wisdom; then I
      could descend to the grave with the proud consciousness that man held of
      his existence the same exalted opinion that I have always tried to teach;
      then would I see this chemical theory of life exploded. Theory which
      degrades man lower than the brutes, makes the subtlest operations of his
      nature a mere chemical effect, and the noble action of the lungs a
      scape-pipe for extra heat; magnificent&mdash;&rdquo; And the excited
      physiologist, carried away by his feelings, burst into one of his wildest
      harangues, battling for his favourite theory with more vigour than he had
      ever displayed in the rostrum&mdash;and there never had stood his superior
      for eloquence&mdash;until a knock at the door broke in upon his
      declamatory current and dammed its waters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless me!&rdquo; he exclaimed, rubbing his glasses and looking at his watch,
      &ldquo;is my time out? Why, I have done all the talking. But go, Mr. Tensas, the
      views that you advocate attest your qualifications. You may depend upon my
      vote and influence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two votes safe!&rdquo; said I, as I regained the lobby, &ldquo;and now for old '<i>Roots</i>,'
      as the professor of Mat. Med. was familiarly called by the class&mdash;he's
      deaf, but thinks no one knows it but himself. I'll talk low, and he won't
      know whether I am answering correctly or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take a seat, Mr. Tensas. How are you to-day? I suppose you are ready for
      being examined? What is calomel?&rdquo; All this being said <i>sotto voce</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A drug, sir, that may be called the right bower of quackery, and the four
      aces of medical murder; referred to by Shakspeare when he said, 'Throw
      physic to the dogs,' and specifically mentioned by him, though a typo
      graphical error has somewhat obscured it, evidencing its antiquity and
      universal administration at his time in the lines, 'Be thou as pure as
      ice, as chaste as snow, thou shalt not escape Calumel.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I spoke in a whisper, but moved my lips as if vociferating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right, Mr. Tensas; but you need not holler so as to alarm the college; I
      am not deaf. What is the usual dose in the South?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Half a pound for an infant, and the quadrature of the stomach's circle
      for a grown negro!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are its specific effects upon the system?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The free use of coffins, spit-boxes, mush-and-milk, and the invention of
      new oaths with which to curse the doctor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What diseases is it usually given in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In all, and some others, from want of a clean shirt to the death-rattle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right, sir, right,&rdquo; said the examiner, never doubting, from my aptitude
      of reply and perfect seriousness, but that they were to the point. &ldquo;What
      are emetics?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Medicines, that a man who has dined badly, and wants to conceal it,
      should never take!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are the most certain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first cigar, the first quid, or a spoiled oyster!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is their action?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That of money won at gambling; going back the way it came, and taking a
      good deal more than it brought!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When should lobelia be given?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At elections, where the people are writing a man down an ass, and he
      wants to be <i>brought-up</i> ahead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What dose would you give it in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the patient was likely to leave a rich widow, I'd certainly give a
      pound!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When would you think an emetic had acted sufficiently?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I was in doubt whether it was the patient's tongue or his stomach
      that was hanging out of his mouth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are purgatives?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Medicines, whose action bears the same relation to that of emetics, which
      the possums did to the hollow where the dog was waiting to catch them&mdash;they
      go the other way!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose your patient had a diarrhoea, what medicine would you give?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A quart of brandy, for it would be sure to make him <i>tight!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are the most dangerous preparations of lead?&rdquo;

     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the fact of bees living in hives, and there being honey in it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right, sir! all right! You have answered admirably. I see I must vote for
      you. You can go, sir!&rdquo;&mdash;and out I went.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three votes! Hurrah! Two more, and I'm safe. Now for Old Sawbones. I'm
      sure of him, though;&rdquo; for upon surgery I was prepared, and my intimacy
      with that professor assured me he must be aware of it, and would attribute
      the errors I might commit to natural trepidation under the circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a man of too much good sense to wheedle or fool with, and
      notwithstanding my confidence in my good preparation, and his appreciation
      of it, I anticipated a terrible time with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      My heart sank as I entered his room. &ldquo;Be seated, Mr. Tensas. Beautiful
      weather for this season. Have an apple? Here is an instrument for
      deligating the subclavian artery, that the maker has done me the honour to
      call after me. How do you like it? Think I must order a dozen. Do to give
      to acquaintances,&rdquo; rattled on the kind-hearted professor, trying to
      reassure me, which he failed to do, for I regarded his pleasantry as
      somewhat akin to the cat sporting with its victim. &ldquo;You never shave,
      Tensas, I believe? Apropos, how old are you?&rdquo; I jumped clear out of my
      seat at the question. The institution required a candidate to be
      twenty-one, which I was not, by several months.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's rather late in the day to inquire that, professor,&rdquo; replied I, &ldquo;you
      should have asked that before I paid for your ticket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you are old enough to be examined for your degree, I expect, as
      you'll be rejected, in all probability. How do you make chicken-soup?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I began to get nettled, thinking he was sporting with me upon my
      embarrassed condition; but a glance at his face told me he was, or
      strongly pretending to be, in earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Professor&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I came here, sir, to be
      examined upon surgery; not to be insulted, sir. What chicken-soup has to
      do with it, I cannot imagine. If you are disposed to twit me with my early
      life and humble occupation, I can assure you, sir&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop! stop! No insult was intended, and though you, with your wisdom of
      almost twenty-one years, cannot see the connexion between soup and
      surgery, I can tell you, young man, that the success of the surgeon
      depends very much upon kitchen medicine. Good soup is easily digested, and
      strengthens the patient, but bad discomposes, and prevents the reparative
      action of the system. But this is not answering my question. How do you,
      sir, make chicken soup?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seeing that if he was not in earnest, it was the best imitation I had seen
      lately, I vouchsafed to answer the subtle inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      After I had concluded&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Tensas, you have left out a very
      important item in the preparation of your soup: you forgot to mention in
      the first instance whether you would kill the chicken or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The glance I shot at him was too much for his gravity. Bursting into a
      hearty laugh, he' said, &ldquo;Tensas, I knew you were well prepared, but I
      thought I would teach you that nothing that may be conducive to the
      recovery of our patient, is too trivial to be remembered by the physician&mdash;also
      to try your temper. You have too much of the latter. The sick-bed is a
      fine moderator, however. Go, my dear fellow, study hard, and in ten years
      I will hear from you.&rdquo; Tears sprung into my eyes as I wrung his hand, and
      thanked him, on leaving his room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four votes safe. One more, and the others may go to Hellespont. Now for
      chemistry. &ldquo;How do you do, Mr. Tensas? Be composed, sir. Take a chair.
      Happy to have the opportunity of gratifying my chemical curiosity at your
      expense. I expect you candidates think your professors a very inquisitive
      set of fellows about this time. Ha! ha! Take a chair, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Professor&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, I am quite well, I am happy to
      inform you, and desirous of appearing as composed as possible. I also
      felicitate myself that it is in my power to display to you the fruits, as
      elaborated in my mind, of those eloquent expositions of chemical science
      which it has been my good fortune to receive, at such an inadequate
      remuneration, from your lips. Here is a pamphlet, very denunciatory, I am
      sorry to announce, of you, that I thought you would like to see. It is by
      the professor of physiology, and appearing first in a distant city, I
      thought you might not be aware of its publication; my admiration and
      friendship for you, together with my anxiety for the promotion of the
      Liebigian system, led me to procure a copy at an expense which, though
      considerable in the present dilapidated condition of my finances, never
      caused the least hesitation in its purchase, when the great good which
      doubtless would result from your early acquaintance with its pernicious
      principles was considered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It took me at least five minutes, in a slow, monotonous, and pompous
      manner, to deliver this, and only ten were left to the examiner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Tensas, thanks for your kind consideration for myself and
      the system I am proud to advocate, even though it be through detraction
      and vituperation. I will examine it at my leisure&mdash;we have now other
      business before us. Give me an exposition, Mr. Tensas, of the Atomic or
      Daltonian theory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Down below zero went my hitherto buoyant spirits&mdash;my scheme had
      failed&mdash;I am gone, thought I, when up my heart bounded again as he
      interrupted me with, &ldquo;Ah! how did you say you obtained this atrocious
      publication? Mr. Tensas, that gentleman, the author, is doing a great and
      irremediable injury to the cause of truth and scientific controversy. In
      arguing with a man of philosophical pretensions, it is to be expected that
      he will combat only those principles which&rdquo;&mdash;and in a tone of grieved
      and wounded innocence, not giving me an opportunity of giving him the
      required exposition of the Atomic or Daltonian theory, <i>which I very
      much regretted</i>, the professor concluded the time allotted him for
      examination, saying, as I bid him adieu, &ldquo;Mr. Tensas, I shall be happy to
      see you at my house to-night; you may rest assured of my vote.&rdquo; I stood in
      the lobby with perfect ease, confident that in having five votes out of
      the seven&mdash;three being required to reject&mdash;I was soon to be
      dubbed Doctor of Medicine. The examinations of the other two professors I
      got through with very summarily, fainting away before one, and occupying
      the fifteen minutes to restore me, and before the other, being seized with
      a violent bleeding at my nose; but in justification of my own honour, I
      must state that the representations by the rest of the faculty of the
      splendid examination I had passed before them, influenced their votes, and
      I obtained all; and, at the appointed time, received my degree, and a
      square yard of sheepskin, as an attestation of the progress I had made in
      medicine, giving me a free permit to kill whom I pleased without the fear
      of the law.

    <h2>
      STEALING A BABY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> never was partial
      to dogs (although I dined some years ago very heartily upon the haunch of
      one, that a rascally Indian sold to the family for venison&mdash;the
      scoundrel's back gave proof not long after, that it, to him at least, was
      really dear meat); they have always been my aversion, and the antipathy of
      my earlier years has not been in the least diminished by the part one took&mdash;not
      only out of my leg&mdash;but in breaking off as pretty a love-scrape as
      ever Cupid rejoiced at.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was attending my last course of lectures, previous to graduation, in a
      northern state, and as a matter of course had but very little leisure to
      devote to amusement or love. But nevertheless, even amidst all my
      occupation, I found time to renew and continue a friendship bordering
      closely upon love, even then, which I had formed the previous winter, with
      a young lady residing in the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were both young&mdash;alas! that there similarity ceased&mdash;she was
      beautiful&mdash;my ugliness was so apparent that I acknowledged it myself.
      She was wealthy&mdash;I had nothing but my profession, it not then secure.
      She was&mdash;but why continue the enumeration of our contrasts? suffice
      it to say that we were fast approaching the condition when love in a
      cottage, and thoughts of an annual searching for sentimental and beautiful
      names occupy so much of the mind, when an infernal dog (not only of a
      daddy&mdash;but a real caniner) jumped&mdash;like a swamp gal into a jar
      of pickles&mdash;into the ring of our felicity, and left me to wail him
      first, and myself afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hated dogs, and the father of my beloved had an equal aversion to
      Southerners, and according to the degree that class stood in his
      estimation, the old man and myself disliked the same objects; so his
      daughter and myself had to meet by stealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twice a week the class of medical students attended clinical lectures at
      the hospital, which was situated in a retired part of the town; thither
      the young lady, on the appointed evenings, would repair, and awaiting the
      departure of the class, we, on our walk homewards, could talk over our
      love affairs without fear or interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      This pleasant arrangement had continued until nearly the close of the
      session, and we had agreed that when graduated, if her father's obduracy
      did not soften, we would elope, when some good-natured friend kindly
      informed her father of our intimacy, and that even as he came then to
      apprise him, he had met her going to keep her appointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Highly incensed, the old man started off to pursue her, out unfortunately
      did not arrive to prevent, but only witness an occurrence which attracted
      considerable attention at the time. Anatomy has been ever with me a
      favourite branch of my profession; and when a student, I never let slip an
      opportunity, time and material permitting, to improve myself in it by
      dissection. It was a passion with me; and whenever I met with a person
      extremely emaciated or finely developed, my anatomical eye would scan
      their proportions, and instead of paying them the usual courtesies of
      life, I would be thinking what glorious subjects they would be for museum
      preparations or dissection; and even when my audacious lips were stealing
      a kiss from the pulpy mouth of my lady-love, instead of floating into
      ecstasies of delight, my anatomical mind would wonder whether, even in
      death, electricity, by some peculiar adaptation, might not be able to
      continue their bewitching suction. When holding her soft hand in mine, and
      gazing into the star-lit ocean of her soul, I would wonder if there was
      not some peculiarity in the formation of her optic nerve which gave her
      eyes such brilliancy. My poetical rhapsodies were mingled with scraps of
      anatomy, and in attempting to write her some verses, after writing the
      first line,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;The clouds which clothed yon beauteous shore with garments
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      dark and hazy&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      to save me, the nearest approximation I could make to a rhyme, was:
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Pray use with me not the '<i>levator labii superioris alaque nasi</i>?
    </p>
    <p>
      To tell the truth, I was becoming clean daft upon the <i>subject</i>, and
      consumptive people and orphan children began to look on me with suspicion,
      but Lucy attributed my conduct-to the eccentricities of genius and love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Connected with the hospital the class attended was a dead-house, as is
      usual in such establishments, where such patients whose constitutions are
      not strong enough to stand the treatment, are deposited after death for
      forty-eight hours, in order that their friends may reclaim their bodies.
      The <i>morgue</i>, in this institution, was directly under the lecture
      room, but, as the door was kept locked, it was regarded as sufficiently
      private.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the day when my intended father-in-law was made acquainted with the
      clandestine meetings of his daughter and myself, I had, as usual,
      accompanied the class to the hospital, and, during the delivering of the
      lecture, becoming suddenly very faint, I was forced to leave the crowded
      room and seek the fresh air.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I passed the door of the dead-house on my return, I noticed that it was
      ajar, and curiosity prompting me to see what was within, I pushed it open
      and entered, closing it behind me. There were several bodies, male and
      female, cleanly arrayed upon the table; but the object that attracted my
      attention the most was an infant a few weeks old lying by the side of its
      dead mother; they were both so black in the face that I would have
      suspected foul play, had it not been accounted for by the fact that they
      were negroes. I strove to depart, but something formed a bond of
      association between that dead nigger baby and myself, which held me to my
      place, my gaze riveted upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wanted just such a subject&mdash;one I could carry up in my private room
      and dissect whilst I was waiting for my meals&mdash;something to wile away
      my tedious hours with&mdash;but how to get it was the thing; the rules of
      the college and hospital were imperative, and I did not wish to be
      expelled. I could not beg, borrow, or buy&mdash;there was but one way
      left, and that was stealing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plan was simple and easily arranged. It was very cold weather, and
      under the ample folds of my cloak the baby would be concealed effectually.
    </p>
    <p>
      Separating it from its dead mother's embrace, I rolled it, tenderly as if
      alive, into as small a space as possible, and tying it up in my
      handkerchief, I placed it under my cloak, and left the dead-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had I left immediately for home, on the baby's absence being discovered I
      would have been suspected immediately; so, great as was the danger, I had
      no other resource than to return to the lecture-room, and await our
      regular dismissal, running the chances of detection. No one, on looking at
      me then, would have accused me of feigning sickness; for, manfully as I
      strove to be composed, the danger of discovery unnerved me completely, and
      gave me such a tremor as would have passed for a creditable ague.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been often enough in imminent danger of my life, to know what cold
      sweat and minutes appearing hours are; but the longest life, in the
      shortest space of time I ever led, was when, in the midst of four hundred
      students, I sat on those hard old benches, with the dead nigger baby under
      my cloak, waiting for the lecture to conclude.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had its end at last; and, waiting till the class had pretty well
      dispersed, I sauntered slowly away towards my boarding-house, hoping that
      the inclemency of the weather had kept Lucy from keeping our usual
      appointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sleety rain had fallen the preceding night, and, like Mrs.
      Blennerhasset's tears, freezing as it fell, had covered the pavement with
      a thin coat of ice, making the walking for pedestrians very insecure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surely, I thought, as a keen gust came round the corner, piercing my
      marrow with its coldness, her tender frame will not be exposed on such a
      day as this! 'tis a good thing, too; for she would be horrified if she
      found what my burden was;&mdash;when her smiling face, with her beautiful
      nose red as an inflamed eye, appeared, and told me I did not possess a
      proper appreciation of the strength of a Kentucky gal's affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somewhat vexed, and, for the first time in my life, sorry to see her, I
      wished her (as it was so cold) in the hottest place I knew of; but
      dissembling my feelings, I vowed, when she came up, that if I had received
      the appointment of surgeon-general to the angels, it could not give me
      more pleasure than to see her then. I appeared as unconcerned as I could,
      and sedulously talked to her of such things as are very interesting to
      lovers and old maids, but deuced tiresome to all other parties concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had nearly reached the street corner where we usually parted, when,
      horror of horrors! who should we see coming round the identical corner but
      the lady's father, accompanied by a man that bore a marvellous resemblance
      to the city marshal!
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of fainting, Lucy uttered a stifled shriek, and gritting her teeth
      dragged me into a house, the door of which stood invitingly open; one step
      more, and if Fate had not been against me, these pages would never have
      been written, that baby would have been anatomized, and in all
      probability, instead of being an old rusty swamp doctor, &ldquo;caring a cuss
      for nobody, nobody caring for me,&rdquo; I would have been the happy head of a
      family, and, rolling in my carriage, describe the great operation of
      extracting two jaw-teeth, I saw performed the last time I was in Paris.
      But the beautiful hath departed, and never was.
    </p>
    <p>
      A growl, a loud yell, bow! wow! wow! and with mouth distended like an
      alligator catching his dessert of flies, a huge bull dog sprang at us,
      placing us in rather a dilemma; it was the dog of a daddy on one hand, and
      the daddy of a dog on the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike Miss Ullin, who preferred meeting the raging of the skies to an
      angry father, embarked in a skiff and got drowned, I preferred an angry
      father to a mad bull dog; so seizing Lucy, I made a spring backwards,
      forgetting in my haste the slippery pavement; our feet flew up, and down
      we came in the open street, cross and pile, our inferior extremities
      considerably intermingled, and her ankles not as well protected from the
      heat as they might have been.
    </p>
    <p>
      My cloak flew open as I fell, and the force of the fall bursting its
      envelope, out, in all its hideous realities, rolled the infernal imp of
      darkness upon the gaze of the laughing, but now horrified spectators.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man had witnessed the whole scene; springing to my feet, I
      assisted the lady to rise, and handed her over to her father. As he
      disappeared with her round the corner, I volunteered to whip the crowd,
      individually or collectively, but nobody seemed disposed to accept of my
      services. Picking up my baby, I explained the whole to a constable who was
      on the point of arresting me for child-murder.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sent the subject back to the dead-room, and came as near being expelled
      from college as ever a lover of knowledge did, to miss it. I have never
      seen Lucy since, and my haggard features and buttonless coat testify that
      the swamp doctor is still a bachelor.

      THE &ldquo;SWAMP DOCTOR&rdquo; TO ESCULAPIUS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>ehold me, then,
      who late was a city physician of a week's duration, a veritable &ldquo;Swamp
      Doctor,&rdquo; settled down quietly, far from the blandishments of fashionable
      life, and awaiting, as when in town, though with not half of my then
      anxiety, the &ldquo;first call.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A veritable &ldquo;Swamp Doctor,&rdquo; to whom French boots and broadcloth must be
      obsolete ideas; the honest squatters thinking&mdash;and with propriety too&mdash;that
      a doctor who could put broadcloth over their stiles, must have to charge
      very high to support such extravagance. A charge to which 'it is almost
      fatal for a doctor to lay himself liable to.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pair of coarse mud boots enclose my feet; copperas-coloured linsey pants
      occupy their proper position; a gaudy plaid vest with enormous jet
      buttons, blanket-coat and cap, complete the equipment of my outer man.
      Allow me to introduce you to my horse; for Charley occupies in my mind too
      large a space to be passed over silently when the &ldquo;Swamp Doctor&rdquo; is being
      described. Too poor to own but one, he has to perform the labour of
      several, which the fine blood that courses through his veins easily
      enables him to do; like his master, his external appearance is rather
      unprepossessing; but would that thy master, Charley, possessed thy
      integral virtues! Higli-spirited art thou, old friend&mdash;for age is
      touching thee, Charles, though thou givest no indication of it, save in
      the lock of gray which overhangs thy flashing eyes. Tall in thy
      proportions, gaunt in thy outline, sorrel in thy hue, thou hast proved to
      me, Charles, that there is other friendship and companioning besides human
      kind; thou hast shared my lowly lot for many years, Charles&mdash;together
      we have passed the lonely night, lost in the swamp&mdash;breasted many an
      angry stream, and given light to many darksome hearts, when fever-stricken
      they awaited my coming, and heard thy joyous neigh and eager bound. I did
      not know thy good qualities, Charles, when first I bought thee, but the
      years that have wasted away have taught thy true worth, and made me
      respect thee as a man. But I must return, Charles, to when we first took
      up our home within the &ldquo;swamp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My residence is as humble as my pretensions or my dress, being composed of
      split trees, and known in American parlance as a &ldquo;log cabin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A lazy sluggish &ldquo;bayou&rdquo;&mdash;as all the small watercourses in this
      country are Frenchifically termed&mdash;glorying in the name of the
      &ldquo;Tensas,&rdquo; runs, or rather creeps, by the door, before which&mdash;on the
      margin of the stream&mdash;stands one of those grand alluvial oaks which
      could canopy an army.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day is rather sultry; a soft wind is moving its branches, on the
      topmost one of which is perched a mocking-bird; how wildly he carols, how
      blithesome his every movement! Happy fellow! the barn-yard, the ploughed
      ground, the berry-laden tree, all furnish him with food. Nature clothes
      him annually, and the leafy branch be neath shields him from the cold,
      when clouds and dark ness gather around. Happy fellow! he can sing with a
      light heart; his wants are few, and easily supplied. Would that the &ldquo;Swamp
      Doctor&rdquo; had as little care pressing upon him, that he might join you in
      your song; would that his necessities were as few and as readily provided
      for! Then, too, he could mock at the world, then, too, sing like thine a
      joyous strain; but poverty, youthfulness, the stranger's want of loving
      sympathy, chill the rising ardour of his song, and fling him back upon the
      cold wave of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      But away, care, for the present! away, forebodings of the future! Be as in
      former days, Swamp Doctor, joyful at heart&mdash;thou hast sung in strains
      as wild as that winsome bird's! Let the harmony that pervades the air
      paint for thee the future; and of bygones, &ldquo;let the dead Past bury its
      dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thou hast sung, Swamp Doctor! Then tune afresh thy harp, and give one
      strain before thy &ldquo;first call&rdquo; shall still with its responsibilities thy
      harp, and clothe with sober seriousness thy youthful heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sayest thou so, fair bird? then will I obey. My seat is beneath thy oak&mdash;thine
      I call it, for early residence hath given thee a pre-emption to it, surely&mdash;thy
      song is pouring through my heart, the wave at my feet is glistening in the
      morning sun, the soft branches overhead rustle and mingle in joyful
      greenness, yet I cannot sing of these fair scenes; not of them can be the
      burden of my song. Manhood had not set its seal upon my form; yet not
      fifty holds an older heart than beats within my breast. In despite of
      myself my thoughts are with my calling, with the sick and suffering who
      are yet to cast their eyes upon my face, and from it draw their bright
      hope or withering despair. What, then, so proper, since sing I must, as
      breathing a soft prayer to the patron saint of the healing art, and
      invoking his assistance in my future course?

      MY FIRST CALL IN THE SWAMP.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>ome quick, Mass'
      Doctor! ole missus got a fit!&rdquo; aroused me from my poetical revery, and
      brought the invocation to Esculapius to an abrupt termination.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was just apostrophizing &ldquo;High Heaven&rdquo; when the voice outspoke; laughing
      at the ludicrous transition of sounds and ideas, I rolled up my manuscript
      and turned to take a survey of the speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      He presented nothing remarkable in his appearance, being only a negro
      messenger, belonging to a small planter living at the extremity of what I
      regarded as my legitimate circuit of practice; from the appearance of the
      mule he bestrode, he had evidently ridden in great haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perceiving me to be laughing, and not knowing of anything in his
      annunciation to create mirth, he thought I had not heard him when he first
      spoke, and therefore repeated, &ldquo;Come quick, Mass' Doctor! ole missus got a
      fit, an' I 'spec is monstrus low, for as I cum by de lot, I hear Mass'
      Bill holler to Mass' Bob, and tell him, arter he got dun knockin' de horns
      off de young bull, to cum in de house an' see his gran'-mammy die.&rdquo; But
      still I laughed on&mdash;there was such an odd mingling of poetry,
      Esculapius, missus, fit, Mass' Bob, and knocking the horn off the young
      bull, as to strike full my bump of the ludicrous, and the negro, sitting
      on his little crop-eared mule, gazed at me in perfect astonishment, as a
      monument of unfeelingness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the recollection that this was my &ldquo;first call,&rdquo; came over and
      sobered me in a second; my profession, with all its sober realities and
      responsibilities, was again triumphant, and I stood a serious &ldquo;Swamp
      Doctor.&rdquo; Ordering a servant to catch my horse, I began to prepare for the
      ride, by questioning the negro as to the nature of the disease, age of the
      patient, and other circumstances of the case, that might enable me to
      carry medicines along suitable to the occasion, as my saddlebags were of
      limited capacity, and none of the people kept medicines at home, except a
      few of the simplest nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say your mistress has fits! Does she have them often?&rdquo; The object of
      my inquiries will be apparent to the professional reader.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not as I nose on, Mass' Doctor, although I did hearn her say when she
      lived in Georgy, she was monstrus nar-vus-like at de full of de moon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How old is your mistress? do you know, boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How ole! why, Mass' Doctor, she's a bobbullushunary suspensioner, an' her
      hare is grayer dan a 'possum's. Ole missus ole for a fak!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has anything happened lately that could have given your mistress the
      fit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nuffin', Mass' doctor, as I nose on, 'cept pr'aps day 'fore yisterday
      night ole missus private jug guv out, an' she tole wun of de boys to go in
      de smoke-house and draw him full; de fule chile stuck de lite tu nere de
      baril, de whiskey cotch, an' sich a 'sploshun never war herd as de ole
      smoke-house guvin' up de goast!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your old mistress drinks whiskey, then, and has been without any two
      days?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mass' doctor, an' 'I 'spec it's that what's usen her ip, for she'd
      sorter got 'customed to de 'stranger.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had learned enough of the case to give me a suspicion of the disease;
      the verification must be deferred until I saw the patient.
    </p>
    <p>
      She being very old, nervous, and excitable, accustomed to alcoholic
      stimulation, suddenly deprived of her usual beverage, and brought under
      the depressory influences of losing her smoke-house and barrel of whiskey,
      was sufficient cause to produce a case of disease formed by an
      amalgamation of <i>sub-hysteria</i> and <i>quasi delirium tremens</i>; a
      not very flattering diagnosis, considered in a moral point of view, to the
      old lady, whose acquaintance I was yet to make. Knowing how much depended
      upon the success with which I treated my first cases, it was unnecessary
      to give me a serious and reflective air, that I should remember how much
      people judged from appearances, and that mine were anything but indicative
      of the doctor; whiskers or beard had I none, and even when wearing the
      most sober mask, a smile would lurk at the corner of my mouth, eager to
      expand into a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I must start. Labelling a bottle of brandy &ldquo;Arkansas Fitifuge,&rdquo; I
      slipped it in my pocket, and mounting my horse, set off upon the
      fulfilment of my &ldquo;first call.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When we reached the house, my horse reeking with sweat, from the haste
      with which we had traversed the muddy roads, I introduced myself, as I had
      never seen one of the family before, nor they me&mdash;as Doctor Tensas,
      and required to be shown the patient. I saw from the countenances of the
      assembly, which was more numerous than I had expected to find, that they
      were disappointed in the appearance of the new doctor, and that my
      unstriking and youthful visage was working fatally against me. In fact, as
      I approached the bed, which was surrounded with women, I heard one old
      crone remark &ldquo;<i>sotto voce</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;Blessed J&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;s! is
      that <i>thing</i> a doctor? why, his face's as smooth as an eggshell, an'
      my son John 'peers a heap older than him, an' he's only been <i>pupped</i>
      ateen years; grashus nose sich a young lookin' critter as that shuddent
      gin me doctor's truck; he can't have 'sperience, but sens he's here we'll
      have to let him go on; half a 'pology is better 'an no commisseration in
      an aggervated insult.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Paying no attention to her depreciatory remarks, but determined to show
      them that I knew a thing or two, I commenced examining the patient.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had I not been prepared by the negro's description, I would have been
      surprised at the example of longevity in that insalubrious country which
      the invalid presented. Judging from external appearances, she must have
      had the opportunity of doing an immensity of talking in her time; her hair
      was whiter than the inside of a persimmon seed, and the skin upon her face
      resembled a piece of corrugated and smoky parchment, more than human
      cuticle; it clove tightly to the bones, bringing out all their
      prominencies, and showing the course of the arteries and veins beneath;
      her mouth was partly open, and on looking in I saw not the vestige of a
      tooth; the great dentist, Time, had succeeded in extracting the last. She
      would lie very quietly in a dull comatose condition for a few moments, and
      then giving a loud screech, attempt to rub her stomach against the rafters
      of the cabin, mumbling out something about &ldquo;Whiskey spilt&mdash;smoke-house,
      ruined&mdash;and Gineral Jackson fit the Injuns&mdash;and she haddent the
      histericks!&rdquo; requiring the united strength of several of the women to keep
      her on the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The examination verified my suspicion as to the nature of the disease, but
      I had too much knowledge of human nature to give the least intimation to
      the females of my real opinion. I had been told by an old practitioner of
      medicine, &ldquo;if you wish to ruin yourself in the estimation of your female
      patients, hint that the disease they are labouring under is connected with
      hysterics:&rdquo; what little knowledge I had acquired of the sex during my
      student life went to confirm his observations. But if the mere intimation
      of hysteria produced such an effect, what would the positive pronouncing
      that it was not only hysterics but a touch of drunken mania? I had not
      courage to calculate upon such a subject, but hastily dismissed it.
      Pronouncing that she had <i>fits</i>, sure enough, I commenced the
      treatment. Brandy and opium were the remedies indicated; I administered
      them freely at half-hour intervals, with marked benefit, and towards
      midnight she fell into a gentle slumber. As I heard her quiet breathing,
      and saw the rise and fall of her bosom in regular succession, indicating
      that the disease was yielding to my remedies, a gleam of pleasure shot
      over my face, and I felt happier by the bedside of that old drunken woman,
      in that lowly cabin, in that obscure swamp, than if the many voices of the
      city were shouting &ldquo;laus&rdquo; unto my name. I was taking the first round in
      the race between medicine and disease, and so far was leading my
      competitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now past midnight: up to this time I had kept my place by the
      bed-side of the patient, and began to get wearied. I could with safety
      transfer her care now to one of the old dames, and I determined to do so,
      and try and obtain some sleep. The house consisted of a double log cabin,
      of small dimensions, a passage, the full depth of the house, running
      between the &ldquo;pens.&rdquo; As sleep was absolutely required for the preservation
      of the patient, and the old dames who were gathered around the fire,
      discoursing of the marvels of their individual experience, bid fair to
      step over the bounds of proper modulation in their garrulity, I proposed,
      in such a way that there was no withstanding the appeal, that we should
      all, except the one nursing, adjourn to the other room. The old ladies
      acquiesced without a single demurrer, as they were all dying to have a
      talk with the &ldquo;young doctor,&rdquo; who hitherto, absorbed in his patient, had
      shown but little communicativeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The male portion of the family had adjourned to the fodder-house to pass
      the night, so my once fair companions and self had the whole of the
      apartment to ourselves. Ascertaining by actual experiment that it was
      sufficiently removed by the passage to prevent ordinary conversation from
      being audible at the bed-side of the invalid, the old ladies, in despite
      of my hints of &ldquo;being very tired,&rdquo; &ldquo;really I am very sleepy,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I wish
      I hadn't such a long ride to take to-morrow,&rdquo; commenced their attack in
      earnest, by opening a tremendous battery of small talk and queries upon
      me. The terrible breaches that it made, had the effect of keeping <i>mine</i>
      on, and I surrendered at discretion to the ladies, <i>almost</i> wishing,
      I must confess, that they were a bevy of young damsels, instead of a set
      so antiquated that their only knowledge of love was in seeing their
      grand-children. Besides, they were only exacting from me the performance
      of one of the prescribed duties of the country physician, performed by him
      from time immemorial; and why should they not exact it of me? The doctor
      of a country settlement was then&mdash;they have become so common now as
      to place it in the power of nearly every planter to own a physician, and
      consequently they attract little regard&mdash;a very important character
      in the community. Travelling about from house to house, he became the
      repository of all the news, scandal, and secrets of the neighbourhood,
      which he was expected to retail out as required for the moral edification
      of the females of his &ldquo;beat;&rdquo; consequently, his coming was an event of
      great and exciting interest to the womenkind generally.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a trite observation, that when you have rendered yourself popular
      with the wife, you are insured of the patronage of the husband apply it to
      the whole sex of women, and it still holds good&mdash;married or single
      they hold the men up, and without their support, no physician can succeed.
      I had imagined, in my youthful simplicity, that when I entered the swamp,
      I had left female curiosity&mdash;regarding it as the offspring of
      polished society&mdash;behind; but I found out my mistake, and though I
      was very sleepy, I loved my profession too well not to desire to perfect
      myself in all the duties of the calling. I have often had a quiet laugh to
      myself, when I reflect upon the incidents of that night, and what a
      ludicrous appearance I must have presented to a non-participant, when, on
      a raw-hide-bottomed chair, I sat in that log cabin, directly in front of a
      cheerful fire&mdash;for though spring, the nights were sufficiently cool
      to render a fire pleasant&mdash;the apex of a pyramid of old women, who
      stretched in two rows, three on each side, down to the jambs of the
      chimney.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was Miss Pechum, and Miss Stivers, and Miss Limsey, on one side, and
      Miss Dims, who, unfortunately, as she informed me, had had her nose bit
      off by a wild hog, and Miss Ripson, and Miss Tillot, on the other. Six old
      women, with case-hardened tongues, and only one poor humble &ldquo;Swamp
      Doctor,&rdquo; whom the verdict of one, at first sight, had pronounced a thing,
      to talk to them all! Fearful odds I saw, and seeing trembled; for the fate
      of the adventurous Frenchman came fresh to my mind, who proposed for a
      wager to talk twelve hours with an old widow, and who at the expiration of
      the time was found dead, with the old lady whispering vainly &ldquo;frog soup&rdquo;
       in his ear. There it was one against one, here it was six versus one, and
      a small talker at that; but the moments were flying, no time was to be
      lost, and we commenced. What marvellous stories I told them about things I
      had seen, and what wonderful recitals they gave me in return! How, first,
      I addressed my attention to one side of the pyramid, and then bestowed a
      commensurate intensity upon the other! How learnedly we discoursed upon
      &ldquo;yarbs,&rdquo; and &ldquo;kumfrey tea,&rdquo; and &ldquo;sweet gum sav!&rdquo; How readily we all
      acquiesced in the general correctness of the broken-nose lady's remark,
      &ldquo;Bless Jesus! we must all die when our time kums,&rdquo; and what a general
      smile&mdash;which I am certain, had it not been for the propinquity of the
      invalid, would have amounted to a laugh&mdash;went round the pyramid, when
      Miss Pechum, who talked through her nose, snuffled out a witticism of her
      youngest son, when he was a babe, in which the point of the joke lay in <i>bite</i>,
      or <i>right</i>, or <i>fight</i>, or some word of some such sound, but
      which the imperfection of her pronunciation somewhat obscured! How
      intently we all listened to Miss Stiver's ghost-story! what upholding of
      hands and lap-dropping of knitting, and exclamations of fear and horror
      and admiration, and &ldquo;Blessed Master!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lordy grashus!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Well, did
      you ever!&rdquo; and &ldquo;You don't say so!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dear heart do tell!&rdquo; and what a
      universal sigh was heaved when the beautiful maid that was haunted by the
      ghost was found drowned in a large churn of buttermilk that her mother had
      set away for market next day! How profuse in my expressions of
      astonishment and admiration I was, when, after a long comparison of the
      relative sufferings of the two sexes, Miss Stivers&mdash;the lady who
      talked through her nose, in reply to Miss Dims, the lady who had no nose
      at all&mdash;declared that &ldquo;Blessed Master permitting arter all their talk
      'bout women's sufferings, she must say that she thought men had the
      hardest time of it, for grashus know's she'd rather have a child every
      nine months than scour a skillet, and she ought to know!&rdquo; How we debated
      'whether the 'hives' were catchin' or not?' and were perfectly unanimous
      in the conclusion that &ldquo;Sheep safern&rdquo; were wonderful &ldquo;truck!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly one of those small screech, or horned owls, so common in the
      South and West, gave forth his discordant cry from a small tree, distant
      only a few feet from the house; instantaneously every voice was hushed,
      all the lower jaws of the old women dropped, every eye was dilated to its
      utmost capacity, till the whites looked like a circle of cream around a
      black bean, every forefinger was raised to command attention, and every
      head gave a commiserative shake, moderating gradually to a solemn
      settling. After a considerable pause, Miss Ripson broke the silence. &ldquo;Poor
      creetur! she's gone, doctor, the Fitifuge can't cure her, she's knit her
      last pair of socks! Blessed Master! the <i>screech owl</i> is hollered,
      and she's bound to die, certin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certin!&rdquo; every voice belonging to the females responded, and every head,
      besides, nodded a mournful acquiescence to the melancholy decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not thoroughly versed in the superstitions of the backwoods, I could not
      see what possible connexion there could be between the screech of the owl
      and the fate of the patient. Desirous of information upon the subject, I
      broke my usual rule, never to acknowledge ignorance upon any matter to
      ladies&mdash;from the first eruption of Vesuvius to the composition of a
      plumptitudinizer&mdash;and therefore asked Miss Ripson to enlighten me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall never forget the mingled look of astonishment and contempt that
      the old lady, to whom the query was propounded, cast upon me as she
      replied:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How dus screech owls hollerin' make sick people die? Blessed Master! you
      a doctor, and ax sich a question! How is ennything fotch 'bout 'cept by
      sines an' awgrese, an' simbles, an' figurashuns, an' hiramgliptix, and
      sich like vareus wase that the Creator works out his desine to man's
      intimashun and expoundin'. Don't spose there's con-jurashun an' majestix
      in the matter, for them's agin scrip-tur; but this much I do no&mdash;I
      never sot up with a sick body, and heard a screech owl holler, or a dog
      howl, or a scratchin' agin the waul, but what they dide; ef they did-dent
      then, they did 'fore long, which pruves that the sine war true; Blessed
      Master! what weke creetur's we is, sure en'uf! I reculleck when I lived
      down to Bunkum County, North Carliny&mdash;Miss Dims, you node Miss
      Ply-ser, what lived down to Zion Spring?&rdquo;&mdash;(Miss Dims, being the
      noseless lady, snuffled out that she did as well as one of her own
      children, as the families were monstrous familiar, and seed a heap of one
      another). &ldquo;Well, Miss Ply-ser war takin awfil sick arter etin a bate of
      cold fride collards&mdash;I alwase tole her cold fride collards warn't
      'dapted to the delicases of her constytushun, but the poor crittur war
      indoost to them, and wuddent taik my device; an' it wood hav been a grate
      dele beter for her ef she had, as the sekil wil pruve; poor creetur! ef
      she oanly had, she mout bin a settin' here to-nite, fur her husband
      shortly arter, sed ef sarkumstancis haddent altired his 'tarmynashun he
      didn't no but wat he wood like to take a look at them Luzaanny botums,
      wair all you had to do to clar the land, war to cut down all the trese and
      wate fur the next overflow to wash them off; but pr'aps she wuddent
      nethur, for arter all he dident cum, an' you no she cuddent kum 'cept with
      him 'ceptin' she dun like Lizey Johnson's middle darter, Prin-sanna, who
      left her husband in the state of Georgy, and kum to Luzaanny an' got
      marred to a nother man, the pi sen varmint, to do sich as that and her own
      laful husband, for I no that he borrerd a dollar of my sister Jane's
      sister to pay for the license and eatables for the crowd&mdash;but Blessed
      Master, where is I talking to!&mdash;well, as I sed, Miss Plyser made
      herself monstrous sick etin cold fride collards; wen I got where she was
      they had sent for the doctor, an' shortly arter I kum he cum, an' the fust
      thins; he axed fur arter he got in the house war for a hanful of
      red-pepper pods&mdash;it war a monstrous fine time for pepper and other
      gardin truck that sesun&mdash;an' wen he got them he tuck a han-ful of
      lobely an' mixt the pepper-pods with it an' then he poured hot bilin'
      water over it, and made a strong decokshun. Jes as it was got reddy for
      'ministering, but before it was guv, I heered a screech owl holler on the
      gable end of the cabin. I sed then as I say now, in the present case, that
      it war a sine and a forerunner that she was gwine to die, but the doctor,
      in spite of my 'swadements, gin her a tin cup of the pepper and lobely'
      but I nude it war no use&mdash;the screech owl had hollered, and she war
      called fur; an' jes to think of a nice young 'ooman like her, with the
      purtiest pair of twins in the world, and as much alike as two pese, only
      one had black hare and lite ise, an' the other had black ise and lite hare&mdash;bein'
      carrid to a grave by cold fride collards apeered a hard case, but the Lord
      is the Heavens an' he nose! Well, the first dose that he gin her didn't
      'fect much, so he gin her another pint, an' then cummenst stemin' her,
      when the pirspirashun began to kum out, she sunk rite down, an' begun to
      siken awful; the cold fride collards began to kum up in gobs, but Blessed
      Master! it war too late, the screech owl had hollered, an' she flung up
      cold fride collards till she dide, pooer creetur! the Lord be marsyful to
      her poor soul! But I sed from the fust she wood die. Doctor, weed better
      see how Miss Jimsey is; it's no use to waste the 'Futifuge' on her, the
      screech owl has hollered, and she mus go though all the doctors of a king
      war here; poor creetur! she has lived a long time, an' I 'speck her Lord
      and Master wants her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And thus saying, the old lady preceded the way to the sick-room, myself
      and the five other old women bringing up the rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somewhat, I thought, to the disappointment of the superstitious dames, we
      found the invalid still buried in a profound slumber, her regular, placid
      breathing indicating that the proper functions of the system were being
      restored. I softly felt her pulse, and it, too, showed improvement.
      Leaving the room, we returned to the other cabin. I informed the family
      that she was much better, and if she did not have a return of the spasms
      by morning, and rested undisturbed in the meantime, that she would get
      well. But I saw that superstition had too deep a hold on their minds for
      my flattering opinion to receive their sanction. An incredulous shake of
      the head was nearly my only reply, except from the owl enthusiast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor, you're mistaken, certin. The screech-owl has hollered, and she is
      boun to die&mdash;it's a sure sign, and can't fail!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I saw the uselessness of argument, and therefore did not attempt to show
      them how ridiculous, nay irreligious, it was to entertain such notions,
      willing that the termination of the case should be the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would require a ponderous tome to contain all that passed in
      conversation during our vigils that night. Morning broke, and I went
      softly in to see if my patient still slept. The noise I made in crossing
      the rough floor aroused, and as I reached the bed-side, she half raised
      herself up, and to my great delight accosted me in her perfect senses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I s'pose, young man, you're a doctor, aint you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I assured her that her surmise was correct, and pressed her to cease
      talking and compose herself. She would not do it, however, but demanded to
      see the medicine I was giving her. I produced the Arkansas Fitifuge, and
      as it was near the time that she should take a dose, I poured one out and
      gave it to her. Receiving it at first with evident disgust, with great
      reluctance she forced herself to drink a small quantity. I saw pleasure
      and surprise lighting up her countenance; she drank a little more&mdash;looked
      at me&mdash;took another sip&mdash;and then, as if to test it by the other
      senses, applied it to her nose, and shaking the glass applied it to her
      ear; all the results were satisfactory, and she drank it to the dregs
      without a murmur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;ef you're a mineral fissishun, and this truck has got
      calomy in it, you needn't be afeard of salavatin me, and stop givin' it,
      for I wont git mad ef my gums is a leetle touched!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I assured her that the &ldquo;Fitifuge&rdquo; was perfectly harmless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's monstrus pleasant truck, ennyhow! What did you say was the name of
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arkansas Fitifuge, madam, one of the best medicaments for spasmodic
      diseases that I have ever used. You were in fits last night when I
      arrived; but you see the medicine is effecting a cure, and you are now out
      of danger, although extreme quietude is highly necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor, will you give me a leetle more of the truck? I declare, it's
      monstrous pleasant. Doctor, I'm mity nar-vous, ginerally; don't you think
      I'd better take it pretty often through the day? Ef they'd sent for you
      sooner I woodent bin half as bad off. But, thank the Lord, you has proved
      a kapable fissishun, sent to me in the hour of need, an' I wont complane,
      but trust in a mersyful Saveyur!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you feel now, sister Jimsey? do you think you're looking up this
      morning?&rdquo; was now asked by the lady of screech-owl memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sister Ripson, thank the Lord, I do feel a power better this mornin',
      an' I think in the course of a day or two I will be able to get about
      agen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, mersyful Master, wonders will never stop! las nite I thot sure you
      cuddent stand it till mornin, speshully arter I heerd the screech-owl
      holler! 'tis a mirrykul, sure, or else this is the wonderfulest doctor in
      creashun!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did the screech-owl holler mor'n wunst, sister Ripson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he only screached wunst! Ef he'd hollered the second time, I'd defide
      all the doctors in the created wurld to 'ad cured you; the thing would
      have bin unpossible!&rdquo; Now as the aforesaid screech-owl had actually
      screeched twice, I must have effected an impossibility in making the cure;
      but I was unwilling to disturb the old lady in her delusion, and therefore
      did not inform her of that, which she would have heard herself, had she
      not been highly alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I directed the &ldquo;Fitifuge&rdquo; to be given at regular intervals through the
      day; and then, amidst the blessings of the patient, the congratulations of
      the family for the wonderful cure I had effected, and their assurances of
      future patronage, took my departure for home, hearing, as I left the
      house, the same old lady who had underrated me at my entrance ejaculate,
      &ldquo;Well, bless the Lord I didn't die last yere of the yaller janders, or I'd
      never lived to see with my own eyes a doctor who could cure a body arter
      the screech-owl hollered!&rdquo;

      is pride! Pride, that busy devil that breaks off the point of the lancet,
      and lets human nature die of the big-head before common sense can bleed

      winter, and the owner shortly in the grave. Pride, that keeps man from

    </p>
    <p>
      I have seen this trait of humanity illustrated in various ways, according
      to the temperament, education, and habits of individuals, and thought I
      knew something of the various workings of the foible; but until I saw
      Major Subsequent, never did I know that man could find his chief glory in
      the possession of loathsome and incurable afflictions. But such is the
      fact, or rather was the fact, for the Major one day came in contact with
      rather a familiar friend of mine, whose known liberality is such that he
      never fails to give his visiters a fee simple to a small plantation. Yes,
      the Major is no more! he died in my arms, or rather a portion of him did;
      for my embrace, to have clasped the whole of his frame, muscle, and fat,
      would have had to be as comprehensive as the recipe for boiling water.
      Reader! in all probability you never knew him; if twoscore has not been
      chalked up against you, I know you never did, for I am now an old,
      bald-headed, wig-wearing Swamp Doctor, and he was buried when my natural
      hair was long as a Yankee pedlar's remembrance of a small debt due him.
      Major Billy Subsequent, F. F. Y. O. K. M. T. R. L. M.
    </p>
    <p>
      H. M. A. M. J. O. G. First Family Virginia, Olways Kritical, Major third
      regiment Louisiana Militia. His mother a Miss Jones of Georgia. Hic
      Jackson. Yes, here is the grave!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Major Billy Subsequent, here are some friends of mine that wish an
      introduction to you. Will you rise? You're sleepy! Ah, Billy, you're a
      grave subject. But my readers are anxious to know you. Read, then, your
      biography from your posthumous memoirs. You haven't got your nap out yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reader, Billy won't rise, so I'll have to do as he directs, and call upon
      your imagination to prepare him from the material I shall offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Billy Subsequent, to use rather an old witticism, was one of the
      most classical men I ever knew. Byron must have had him in his eye&mdash;rather
      a large one would have been required to hold him&mdash;when he wrote his
      beautiful lyric, The iles of grease! the iles of grease! for Billy was fat
      almost to fatuity; nature had set up in his inner man a laboratory to
      convert everything that entered his mouth into adipose or fatty
      corpuscles. He would have been a trump at euchre, for in an emergency he
      could have been played as the right bower at clubs, to which important
      personage he bore a striking resemblance. It would have been impossible to
      have hung him, for he had no neck; his head was rather too hard to have
      suspended him by, and I have yet to learn that a man can be strangulated
      by tying the rope under his arms; so capital execution was not applicable
      to him, except when fish, flesh, fowl, or vegetables were to be devoured,
      and then his execution was capital. He had heard when very young that he,
      like the balance of the human race, possessed feet; but such was his
      abdominal rotundity grown to, that to verify the fact by ocular
      demonstration, was a feat, to accomplish which he would have failed in
      toto. When we beheld his hands, we were struck with their resemblance to a
      pair of boiled hams, notched at the ends sufficiently to correspond to
      fingers and thumbs. He never trusted but one finger in the performance of
      friendship's manipulation, melancholy experience having demonstrated that
      human friendship was grown too weak to be intrusted with an entire hand.
      His face was coveted by every politician in the land, being broad enough
      to smile upon all parties, and look lovingly to all quarters of the Union
      at the same time. His wind, like a doctor's visits of charity, was short,
      but not sweet, his oesophagus being contracted, the proximity of his
      stomach being supposed to affect it in this respect. Set him to walking,
      and his puff! puff! sent every inland planter who had cotton to ship to
      the bayou directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being the lineal descendant of a Scotch prince&mdash;who was hung as the
      finale of an unsuccessful raid&mdash;and belonging to F. F. V., it is
      natural to suppose that he shared in the modesty and personal humility
      that distinguish his like favoured brethren; in fact, he rather externally
      accomplished the thing, imitating them in every particular of common
      glorification, and taking exclusive grounds in things that they never
      dreamt of as forming subjects for self-gratulation. They referred to
      tradition, genealogy, or other equally as creditable sources, to prove
      their purity of blood and excellence of family; but Major Subsequent had
      another test, which with him was indubitably decisive of the present and
      past purity of his genealogical tree. Up to the time of my acquaintance
      with him, his wife, children, and self, all were, and had been from youth,
      in possession of various incurable and afflicting disorders, but according
      to the Major's statement not one of them had ever had a plebeian or
      unfashionable disease. This was the Major's chief source of glory and
      honour. The blood of his family was so pure, that only aristocratic
      diseases could make any morbific impression on their susceptible systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      He prided himself upon his Ciceronian wart and bluff Harry the Eighth
      proportions; every twinge of the gout was a thrill of exquisite pleasure,
      for only high living and pure blood could have the gout. His eldest son
      had the King's Evil&mdash;the King's Evil, mind you! Major Subsequent was
      one of those that believed that kings existed in a perpetual atmosphere of
      delight, and that consequently the King's Evil was only a play-synonyme
      for the king's pleasure, so his eldest born had little of his sympathy.
      His youngest son was terribly humpbacked, but this gave the Major no
      uneasiness, for were not Alexander and Richard humpbacked kings? One of
      his daughters was an old maid, &ldquo;but then,&rdquo; argued the Major, consoling his
      child under this terrible disease, &ldquo;Queen Elizabeth and Cleopatra died old
      maids, and why not you?&rdquo; Another had a perpetual leer upon her
      countenance, &ldquo;but then,&rdquo; quoth the Major, turning to a volume of
      Shakspeare, &ldquo;there was a king Lear, a kingly precedent, Miss Subsequent;
      so don't talk of being operated upon for strabismus.&rdquo; His wife&mdash;but
      enough, you know the man. The Major was very proud of his family, or
      rather of his family's diseases, cherishing them in much the same spirit
      that Jenner, the father of vaccination, did his experimental cow, for the
      scab upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      I became a great favourite with the Major, not that I was diseased in any
      way, but on the contrary always enjoyed good health, but he said that as I
      was one of the chivalry, he was certain if I ever got sick, it would be a
      gentlemanly disease, and none of your d&mdash;&mdash;n plebeian,
      chill-and-fever, poor folks' affections.
    </p>
    <p>
      I used to visit the Major's house often, for the purpose of studying his
      character, and getting a good dinner; for the Major fed well, all but
      horses, and they had to trust the chances of a stray nubbin falling
      through the chinks of the stable loft. Taking good care of a horse meant,
      with him, tying him to a fence, with nothing to eat but the dead wood.
      Taking extraordinary care signified hitching him to a green sapling, where
      he could have the privilege of gnawing the bark.
    </p>
    <p>
      My open admiration of his character soon elevated me to the post of family
      physician&mdash;nearly a sinecure&mdash;for the Major was afraid to take
      medicine, not wishing to part with his hereditary honours.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, I had just finished my dinner at home, and had taken, cigar in
      mouth, my usual seat beneath a favourite oak, to indulge in a fit of
      meditation, when I saw the dust up the bayou road shaken up by a
      half-naked negro, who, having no pockets in his shirt, and being hat-less,
      holding a letter in his teeth, was urging his mule along at the top of his
      speed. At a glance, I knew it was the Major's boy, or rather mule, for no
      one in the settlement save him owned an animal, the ribs of which could be
      counted at almost any distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      They arrived; and first asking me for a chaw of tobacco, the negro
      delivered the note, which, true to my surmise, was from the Major, and
      written apparently under high excitement, requesting me to come up
      immediately, as he apprehended something terrible had either happened, or
      was going to occur.
    </p>
    <p>
      My horse being ready saddled, in a short time I was at the Major's, whom I
      found waddling up and down his long gallery, his path distinctly marked by
      the huge drops of sweat that had fallen from his brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor, I am truly rejoiced at your arrival; my worst apprehensions have
      been excited upon a subject, upon which the honour of my family depends,
      and the firm fame of my ancestors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thinking from his language there was a lady in the case, I told him that
      marriage would cure all indiscretions, and muttered something about
      accidents and the best of families. The Major understood only the
      conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Best of families!&rdquo; repeated he. &ldquo;Yes, doctor, not only of the best, but
      the very best. I pride myself upon my blood. Mine is no upstart claim of a
      thousand years or so, but, doctor, drawn from the very creation, and
      transmitted in a stream of pure brilliancy down to me. But, doctor,
      something has occurred to-day, I fear, which, if it be as my darkest and
      gloomiest thoughts suggest, will prove my death, bring ruin and disgrace
      upon my house, and extinguish the ancient torch of the Subsequents like a
      farthing dip. I have looked over my list of ancestors, from the creation
      up, and find to my ineffable horror not one of them ever died with any but
      a noble and kingly disease. I know I have received the stream in all its
      pristine purity&mdash;and oh, doctor, on your honour as a man, on the
      awful sanctity of your calling, never reveal to mortal the terrible
      disclosure I am about to make. Doctor Tensas, I fear my eldest born has
      got&mdash;faugh! I sicken at the thought&mdash;the chill and fever! Oh,
      Lord, terrible! awful! horrible! Is it not enough to madden a man, to
      think, after having only noble diseases in his family, for twenty thousand
      years at least, that a cursed, plebeian, vulgar disease, which every negro
      and low poor man can have, should dare present itself in the habitation of
      aristocratic and kingly affections. Doctor, if it be as I fear, I shall go
      deranged! I shall die! I will disinherit the rascal! He shall change his
      name! To think of gout, king's evil, humpback, and their royal brethren,
      to attest my purity of blood, and then for chi&mdash;faugh! it is too
      horrible to be true! Go, doctor, examine him. Heaven grant my fears may be
      groundless, or I shall certainly die. I cannot survive the disgrace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Going into the room where the patient lay, I examined him, and sure enough
      chill and fever <i>was there</i> in all its perfection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fearing the effect the revelation might have upon the Major, I attempted a
      pious fraud, and blundered out something about its being a strange,
      singular, and anomalous affection, not laid down in the books&mdash;never
      had seen anything like it before. Certainly not chill and fever, though
      even if it were&mdash;ha! ha!&mdash;it was still a disease, though debased
      very much in modern times, I must confess, not to be looked on with
      coolness, as James the Second and Oliver Cromwell were said to have died
      of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor Tensas, don't deceive me,&rdquo; said the Major. I assured him that I
      did not&mdash;that his son had not the chill and fever. I was not fully
      assured of the nature of his disease, but he might rest easy, as far as
      ague was concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reassured and comforted by my positive declaration and manner, the Major
      heaved a deep sigh of relief, and asked me to stay all night. I would have
      assented, but my old sorrel, remembering his well filled trough at home,
      and fearing some such arrangement, put in an impatient and positive nay,
      and I departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A day passed in quietude; but who knows what the morrow will bring forth?
      I was summoned, in greater haste than before, to the Major's. On reaching
      there, I found him writhing in pain, both bodily and mentally, with a
      handful of buttons, and a couple of jaw-teeth with them, somewhat decayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor Tensas,&rdquo; he thundered out, &ldquo;by the Eternal you deceived me. My son
      had the chill and fever. He has it now! Now, sir, now! Look at these
      buttons off and these teeth shaken out, and then tell me if the blood of a
      line of noble ancestors is not defiled, and my family disgraced forever?&mdash;my
      son have the chill and fever!&rdquo; and a shudder ran over his frame. &ldquo;Chill
      and fever! Ha! ha! ha!&rdquo; a fit of hysterical, demoniacal laughter came over
      him. &ldquo;Chill and fever! Ha! ha! ha!&rdquo; gurgled, mixed with the death-rattle
      from his throat. I looked in his face&mdash;and thus died Major Billy
      Subsequent, F. F. V. &amp;c., of a chill and fever his son had!

    <h2>
      THE INDEFATIGABLE BEAR-HUNTER.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>n my round of
      practice, I occasionally meet with men whose peculiarities stamp them as
      belonging to a class composed only of themselves. So different are they in
      appearance, habits, taste, from the majority of mankind, that it is
      impossible to classify them, and you have therefore to set them down as
      queer birds &ldquo;of a feather,&rdquo; that none resemble sufficiently to associate
      with.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had a patient once who was one of these queer ones; gigantic in stature,
      uneducated, fearless of real danger, yet timorous as a child of
      superstitious perils, born literally in the woods, never having been in a
      city in his life, and his idea of one being that it was a place where
      people met together to make whiskey, and form plans for swindling country
      folks. To view him at one time, you would think him only a
      whiskey-drinking, bear-fat-loving mortal; at other moments, he would give
      vent to ideas, proving that beneath his rough exterior there ran a fiery
      current of high enthusiastic ambition.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a favourite theory of mine, and one that I am fond of consoling
      myself with, for my own insignificance, that there is no man born who is
      not capable of attaining distinction, and no occupation that does not
      contain a path leading to fame. To bide our time is all that is necessary.
      I had expressed this view in the hearing of Mik-hoo-tah, for so was the
      subject of this sketch called, and it seemed to chime in with his feelings
      exactly. Born in the woods, and losing his parents early, he had forgotten
      his real name, and the bent of his genius inclining him to the slaying of
      bears, he had been given, even when a youth, the name of Mik-hoo-tah,
      signifying &ldquo;the grave of bears,&rdquo; by his Indian associates and admirers.
    </p>
    <p>
      To glance in and around his cabin, you would have thought that the place
      had been selected for ages past by the bear tribe to yield up their
      spirits in, so numerous were the relics. Little chance, I ween, had the
      cold air to whistle through that hut, so thickly was it tapestried with
      the soft, downy hides, the darkness of the surface relieved occasionally
      by the skin of a tender fawn, or the short-haired irascible panther. From
      the joists depended bear-hams and tongues innumerable, and the ground
      outside was literally white with bones. Ay, he was a bear-hunter, in its
      most comprehensive sense&mdash;the chief of that vigorous band, whose
      occupation is nearly gone&mdash;crushed beneath the advancing strides of
      romance-destroying civilization. When his horn sounded&mdash;so tradition
      ran&mdash;the bears began to draw lots to see who should die that day, for
      painful experience had told them the uselessness of all endeavouring to
      escape. The &ldquo;Big Bear of Arkansas&rdquo; would not have given him an hour's
      extra work, or raised a fresh wrinkle on his already care-corrugated brow.
      But, though almost daily imbruing his hands in the blood of Bruin,
      Mik-hoo-tah had not become an impious or cruel-hearted man. Such was his
      piety, that he never killed a bear without getting down on his knees&mdash;to
      skin it&mdash;and praying to be d&mdash;&mdash;ned if it warn't a buster;
      and such his softness of heart, that he often wept, when he, by mistake,
      had killed a suckling bear&mdash;depriving her poor offspring of a
      mother's care&mdash;and found her too poor to be eaten. So indefatigable
      had he become in his pursuit, that the bears bid fair to disappear from
      the face of the swamp, and be known to posterity only through the one
      mentioned in Scripture, that assisted Elisha to punish the impertinent
      children, when an accident occurred to the hunter, which raised their
      hopes of not being entirely exterminated.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, Mik happened to come unfortunately in contact with a stray
      grizzly fellow, who, doubtless in the indulgence of an adventurous spirit,
      had wandered away from the Rocky Mountains, and formed a league for mutual
      protection with his black and more effeminate brethren of the swamp. Mik
      saluted him, as he approached, with an ounce ball in the forehead, to
      avenge half a dozen of his best dogs, who lay in fragments around; the
      bullet flattened upon his impenetrable skull, merely infuriating the
      monster; and before Mik could reload, it was upon him. Seizing him by the
      leg, it bore him to the ground, and ground the limb to atoms. But before
      it could attack a more vital part, the knife of the dauntless hunter had
      cloven its heart, and it dropped dead upon the bleeding form of its
      slayer, in which condition they were shortly found by Mik's comrades.
      Making a litter of branches, they placed Mik upon it, and proceeded with
      all haste to their camp, sending one of the company by a near cut for me,
      as I was the nearest physician.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I reached their temporary shelter I found Mik doing better than I
      could have expected, with the exception of his wounded leg, and that, from
      its crushed and mutilated condition, I saw would have to be amputated
      immediately, of which I informed Mik. As I expected, he opposed it
      vehemently; but I convinced him of the impossibility of saving it,
      assuring him if it were not amputated, he would certainly die, and
      appealed to his good sense to grant permission, which he did at last. The
      next difficulty was to procure amputating instruments, the rarity of
      surgical operations, and the generally slender purse of the &ldquo;Swamp
      Doctor,&rdquo; not justifying him in purchasing expensive instruments. A couple
      of bowie-knives, one ingeniously hacked and filed into a saw&mdash;a
      tourniquet made of a belt and piece of stick&mdash;a gun-screw converted
      for the time into a tenaculum&mdash;and some buckskin slips for ligatures,
      completed my case of instruments for amputation. The city physician may
      smile at this recital, but I assure him many a more difficult operation
      than the amputation of a leg, has been performed by his humble brother in
      the &ldquo;swamp,&rdquo; with far more simple means than those I have mentioned. The
      preparations being completed, Mik refused to have his arms bound, and
      commenced singing a bear song; and throughout the whole operation, which
      was necessarily tedious, he never uttered a groan, or missed a single
      stave. The next day, I had him conveyed by easy stages to his pre-emption;
      and tending assiduously, in the course of a few weeks, he had recovered
      sufficiently for me to cease attentions. I made him a wooden leg, which
      answered a good purpose; and with a sigh of regret for the spoiling of
      such a good hunter, I struck him from my list of patients.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few months passed over and I heard nothing more of him. Newer, but not
      brighter, stars were in the ascendant, filling with their deeds the
      clanging trump of bear-killing fame, and, but for the quantity of
      bear-blankets in the neighbouring cabins, and the painful absence of his
      usual present of bear-hams, Mik-hoo-tah bid fair to suffer that fate most
      terrible to aspiring ambitionists&mdash;forgetfulness during life. The
      sun, in despair at the stern necessity which compelled him to yield up his
      tender offspring, day, to the gloomy grave of darkness, had stretched
      forth his long arms, and, with the tenacity of a drowning man clinging to
      a straw, had clutched the tender whispering straw-like topmost branches of
      the trees&mdash;in other words it was near sunset&mdash;when I arrived at
      home from a long wearisome semi-ride-and-swim through the swamp. Receiving
      a negative to my inquiry whether there were any new calls, I was
      felicitating myself upon a quiet night beside my tidy bachelor hearth,
      undisturbed by crying children, babbling women, or amorous cats&mdash;the
      usual accompaniments of married life&mdash;when, like a poor henpecked
      Benedick crying for peace when there is no peace, I was doomed to
      disappointment. Hearing the splash of a paddle in the bayou running before
      the door, I turned my head towards the bank, and soon beheld, first the
      tail of a coon, next his body, a human face, and, the top of the bank
      being gained, a full-proportioned form clad in the garments which, better
      than any printed label, wrote him down raftsman, trapper, bear-hunter. He
      was a messenger from the indefatigable bear-hunter, Mik-hoo-tah. Asking
      him what was the matter, as soon as he could get the knots untied which
      two-thirds drunkenness had made in his tongue, he informed me, to my
      sincere regret, that Mik went out that morning on a bear-hunt, and in a
      fight with one had got his leg broke all to flinders, if possible worse
      than the other, and that he wanted me to come quickly. Getting into the
      canoe, which awaited me, I wrapped myself in my blanket, and yielding to
      my fatigue, was soon fast asleep. I did not awaken until the canoe
      striking against the bank, as it landed at Mik's pre-emption, nearly threw
      me in the bayou, and entirely succeeded with regard to my half-drunken
      paddler, who&mdash;like the sailor who circumnavigated the world and then
      was drowned in a puddle-hole in his own garden&mdash;had escaped all the
      perils of the tortuous bayou to be pitched overboard when there was
      nothing to do but step out and tie the dug-out. Assisting him out of the
      water, we proceeded to the house, when, to my indignation, I learnt that
      the drunken messenger had given me the long trip for nothing, Mik only
      wanting me to make him a new wooden leg, the old one having been
      completely demolished that morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Relieving myself by a satisfactory oath, I would have returned that night,
      but the distance was too great for one fatigued as I was, so I had to
      content myself with such accommodations as Mik's cabin afforded, which, to
      one blessed like myself with the happy faculty of ready adaptation to
      circumstances, was not a very difficult task.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was surprised to perceive the change in Mik's appearance. From nearly a
      giant, he had wasted to a mere huge bony frame-work; the skin of his face
      clung tightly to the bones, and showed nothing of those laughter-moving
      features that were wont to adorn his visage; only his eye remained
      unchanged, and it had lost none of its brilliancy&mdash;the flint had lost
      none of its fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth is the matter with you, Mik? I have never seen any one fall
      off so fast; you have wasted to a skeleton&mdash;surely you must have the
      consumption.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so, Doc? I'll soon show you whether the old bellows has lost
      any of its force!&rdquo; and hopping to the door, which he threw wide open, he
      gave a death-hug rally to his dogs, in such a loud and piercing tone, that
      I imagined a steam whistle was being discharged in my ear, and for several
      moments could hear nothing distinctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do! stop!&rdquo; I yelled, as I saw Mik drawing in his breath
      preparatory to another effort of his vocal strength; &ldquo;I am satisfied you
      have not got consumption; but what has wasted you so, Mik? Surely, you
      ain't in love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love! h&mdash;ll! you don't suppose, Doc, even if I was 'tarmined to make
      a cussed fool of myself, that there is any gal in the swamp that could
      stand that hug, do you?&rdquo; and catching up a huge bull-dog, who lay basking
      himself by the fire, he gave him such a squeeze that the animal yelled
      with pain, and for a few moments appeared dead. &ldquo;No, Doc, it's grief, pure
      sorrur, sor-rur, Doc! when I looks at what I is now and what I used to be!
      Jes think, Doc, of the fust hunter in the swamp having his sport spilte,
      like bar-meat in summer without salt! Jes think of a man standin' up one
      day and blessing old Master for having put bar in creation, and the next
      cussing high heaven and low h&mdash;ll 'cause he couldn't 'sist in puttin'
      them out! Warn't it enough to bring tears to the eyes of an Injun tater,
      much less take the fat off a bar-hunter? Doc, I fell off like 'simmons
      arter frost, and folks as doubted me, needn't had asked whether I war
      'ceitful or not, for they could have seed plum threw me! The bar and
      painter got so saucy that they'd cum to the tother side of the bayou and
      see which could talk the impudentest! 'Don't you want some bar-meat or
      painter blanket?' they'd ask; 'bars is monstrous fat, and painter's hide
      is mighty warm!' Oh! Doc, I was a miserable man! The sky warn't blue for
      me, the sun war always cloudy, and the shade-trees gin no shade for me.
      Even the dogs forgot me, and the little children quit coming and asking,
      'Please, Mr. Bar-Grave, cotch me a young bar or a painter kitten.' Doc,
      the tears would cum in my eyes and the hot blood would cum biling up from
      my heart, when I'd hobble out of a sundown and hear the boys tell, as they
      went by, of the sport they'd had that day, and how the bar fit 'fore he
      was killed, and how fat he war arter he was slayed. Long arter they was
      gone, and the whip-poor-will had eat up their voices, I would sit out
      there on the old stump, and think of the things that used to hold the
      biggest place in my mind when I was a boy, and p'raps sense I've bin a
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd heard tell of distinction and fame, and people's names never dying,
      and how Washington and Franklin, and Clay and Jackson, and a heap of
      political dicshunary-folks, would live when their big hearts had crumbled
      down to a rifle-charge of dust; and I begun, too, to think, Doc, what a
      pleasant thing it would be to know folks a million years off would talk of
      me like them, and it made me 'tarmine to 'stinguish myself, and have my
      name put in a book with a yaller kiver. I warn't a genus, Doc, I nude
      that, nor I warn't dicshunary; so I detarmined to strike out in a new
      track for glory, and 'title myself to be called the 'bear-hunter of
      Ameriky.' Doc, my heart jumpt up, and I belted my hunting-shirt tighter
      for fear it would lepe out when I fust spoke them words out loud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'The bar-hunter of Ameriky!' Doc, you know whether I war ernin' the name
      when I war ruined. There is not a child, white, black, Injun, or nigger,
      from the Arkansas line to Trinity, but what has heard of me, and I were
      happy when&rdquo;&mdash;here a tremor of his voice and a tear glistening in the
      glare of the fire told the old fellow's emotion&mdash;&ldquo;when&mdash;I take a
      drink&mdash;Doc, I found I was dying&mdash;I war gettin' weaker and weaker&mdash;I
      nude your truck warn't what I needed, or I'd sent for you. A bar-hunt war
      the medsin that my systum required, a fust class bar-hunt, the music of
      the dogs, the fellers a screaming, the cane poppin', the rifles crackin',
      the bar growlin', the fight hand to hand, slap goes his paw, and a dog's
      hide hangs on one cane and his body on another, the knife glistenin' and
      then goin' plump up to the handle in his heart!&mdash;Oh! Doc, this was
      what I needed, and I swore, since death were huggin' me, anyhow, I mite as
      well feel his last grip in a bar-hunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I seed the boys goin' long one day, and haled them to wait awhile, as I
      believed I would go along too. I war frade if I kept out of a hunt much
      longer I wood get outen practis. They laughed at me, thinkin' I war
      jokin'; for wat cood a sick, old, one-legged man do in a bar-hunt? how
      cood he get threw the swamp, and vines, and canes, and backwater? and
      s'pose he mist the bar, how war he to get outen the way?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I war 'tarmined on goin'; my dander was up, and I swore I wood go,
      tellin' them if I coodent travel 'bout much, I could take a stand. Seein'
      it war no use tryin' to 'swade me, they saddled my poney, and off we
      started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I felt better right off. I knew I cuddent do much in the chase, so I told
      the fellers I would go to the cross-path stand, and wate for the bar, as
      he would be sarten to cum by thar. You have never seed the cross-path
      stand, Doc. It's the singularest place in the swamp. It's rite in the
      middle of a canebrake, thicker than har oil a bar-hide, down in a deep
      sink, that looks like the devil had cummenst diggin' a skylite for his
      pre-emption. I knew it war a dangersome place for a well man to go in,
      much less a one-leg cripple; but I war 'tarmined that time to give a deal
      on the dead wood, and play my hand out. The boys gin me time to get to the
      stand, and then cummenst the drive. The bar seemed 'tarmined on
      disappinting me, for the fust thing I heard of the dogs and bar, they was
      outen hearing. Everything got quiet, and I got so wrathy at not being able
      to foller up the chase, that I cust till the trees cummenst shedding their
      leaves and small branches, when I herd them lumbrin back, and I nude they
      war makin' to me. I primed old 'bar death' fresh, and rubbed the frizin,
      for it war no time for rifle to get to snappin'. Thinks I, if I happen to
      miss, I'll try what virtue there is in a knife&mdash;when, Doc, my knife
      war gone. H&mdash;ll! bar, for God's sake have a soft head, and die easy,
      for I <i>can't</i> run!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doc, you've hearn a bar bustin' threw a cane-brake, and know how near to
      a harrycane it is. I almost cummenst dodgin' the trees, thinkin' it war
      the best in the shop one a comin', for it beat the loudest thunder ever I
      heard; that ole bar did, comin' to get his death from an ole, one-legged
      cripple, what had slayed more of his brethren than his nigger foot had
      ever made trax in the mud. Doc, he heerd a <i>monstrus long ways ahead of
      the dogs</i>. I warn't skeered, but I must own, as I had but one shot, an'
      no knife, I wud have prefurd they had been closer. But here he cum! he bar&mdash;big
      as a bull&mdash;boys off h&mdash;ll-wards&mdash;dogs nowhar&mdash;no knife&mdash;but
      one shot&mdash;<i>and only one leg that cood run!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bar 'peered s'prised to see me standin' ready for him in the openin';
      for it war currently reported 'mong his brethren that I war either dead,
      or no use for bar. I thought fust he war skeered; and, Doc, I b'leve he
      war, till he cotch a sight of my wooden leg, and that toch his pride, for
      he knew he would be hist outen every she bear's company, ef he run from a
      poor, sickly, one-legged cripple, so on he cum, a small river of slobber
      pourin from his mouth, and the blue smoke curlin outen his ears. I tuck
      good aim at his left, and let drive. The ball struck him on the eyebrow,
      and glanced off, only stunnin' him for a moment, jes givin' me time to
      club my rifle, an' on he kum, as fierce as old grizzly. As he got in
      reach, I gin him a lick 'cross the temples, brakin' the stock in fifty
      pieces, an' knockin' him senseless. I struv to foller up the lick, when,
      Doc, I war fast&mdash;my timber toe had run inter the ground, and I
      cuddent git out, though I jerked hard enuf almost to bring my thigh out of
      joint. I stuped to unscrew the infurnal thing, when the bar cum too, and
      cum at me agen. Vim! I tuck him over the head, and, cochunk, he keeled
      over. H-ll! but I cavorted and pitched. Thar war my wust enemy, watin' for
      me to giv him a finisher, an' <i>I cuddent</i> git at him. I'd cummense
      unscrewin' leg&mdash;here cum bar&mdash;vim&mdash;cochunk&mdash;he'd fall
      out of reach&mdash;and, Doc, <i>I cuddent git to him</i>. I kept work-in'
      my body round, so as to unscrew the leg, and keep the bar off till I cood
      'complish it, when jes as I tuck the last turn, and got loose from the d&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;d
      thing, here cum bar, more venimous than ever, and I nude thar war death to
      one, out, and comin' shortly. I let him get close, an' then cum down with
      a perfect tornado on his head, as I thought; but the old villin had learnt
      the dodge&mdash;the bar-rel jes struck him on the side of the head, and
      glanst off, slinging itself out of my hands bout twenty feet 'mongst the
      thick cane, and thar I war in a fix sure. Bar but little hurt&mdash;no gun&mdash;no
      knife&mdash;no dogs&mdash;no frens&mdash;no chance to climb&mdash;an' <i>only
      one leg that cood run</i>. Doc, I jes cummenst makin' 'pologies to ole
      Master, when an idee struck me. Doc, did you ever see a piney woods nigger
      pullin at a sassafras root? or a suckin' pig in a tater patch arter the
      big yams? You has! Well, you can 'magin how I jarkt at that wudden leg,
      for it war the last of pea-time with me, sure, if I didn't rise 'fore bar
      did. At last, they both cum up, bout the same time, and I braced myself
      for a death struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We fit all round that holler! Fust I'd foller bar, and then bar would
      chase me! I'd make a lick, he'd fend off, and showin' a set of teeth that
      no doctor, 'cept natur, had ever wurkt at, cum tearin' at me! We both 'gan
      to git tired, I heard the boys and dogs cumin', so did bar, and we were
      both anxshus to bring the thing to a close 'fore they cum up, though I
      wuddent thought they were intrudin' ef they had cum up some time afore.

      I made a lick, the noise of the boys and the dogs cummin' sorter confused
      bar, and he made a stumble, and bein' off his guard I got a fair lick! The

      hollered&mdash;but you have heered me holler an' I won't describe it&mdash;I
      had whipped a bar in a fair hand to hand fight&mdash;me, an old sickly
      one-legged bar-hunter! The boys cum up, and, when they seed the ground we
      had fit over, they swore they would hav thought, 'stead of a bar-fight,
      that I had been cuttin' cane and deadenin' timber for a corn-patch, the
      sile war so worked up, they then handed me a knife to finish the work.

      &ldquo;Doc, les licker, it's a dry talk&mdash;when will you make me another leg?

    <h2>
      LOVE IN A GARDEN.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>n the whole range
      of human attributes there are not two more antagonistical qualities than
      courage and cowardice; yet, how frequently we find them existing in the
      same person, ensconced under the same coat of skin! In the form that
      contains a spirit that would face with un-blenching eye the fiercest peril
      of man's existence, we will often discover a timorous sprite, who hems and
      hesitates, and falters and trembles, at an enemy no more formidable than a
      pair of soft blue eyes, pouring their streams of liquid subduing
      tenderness, or else a brace of piercing black orbits, which, like the fire
      of the ancient Greeks, burn the fiercer for the water which love pours
      over them, in the shape of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, odd as it may seem, this discordant association of heroism and
      timidity is not found in weak effeminate nervous men, but in those whose
      almost gigantic proportions, eagle eye, and dauntless bearing convey any
      idea but that there is stuff for trembling in their stalwart frames. But
      they are the ones who generally manifest the greatest cowardice&mdash;place
      them before a battery of girls' eyes, and it proves literally a galvanic
      battery, shocking them to such a degree that they usually do something
      they never intended, and say things that they never meant. Let one of
      these animals be in love, and what a mess he generally makes of the
      affair! Did you ever know one to &ldquo;pop the question&rdquo; in a respectable
      civilized manner?&mdash;That is, if he ever exalted his courage
      sufficiently to get that near to matrimony. My word for it&mdash;never. No
      suit for breach of promise could be ever brought against one of them&mdash;for
      such is the non-committalism of their incoherency, that no woman, on her
      oath, could avow, even were they <i>conjugated</i> at the time, that he
      ever asked her to marry him; the intuitive feeling of her sex alone
      enabled her to draw the idea that he was addressing her, from the mass of
      his discordant, incoherent, lingual ramblings, when the question was being
      popped.
    </p>
    <p>
      This philosophizing is intended as a preface or premonitory symptom of a
      story, illustrative of the trait; which, like measles, when repelled by
      cold air, has struck in upon my memory, and which, carrying out the idea,
      requires, like the aforesaid measles, to be brought to the surface in
      order that I may feel relieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the many acquaintances that my profession enabled me to make in the
      swamp, no one afforded me more pleasure than Jerry Wilson, the son of a
      small planter resident some few miles from my <i>shingle</i>. There was
      something so manly and frank in his bearing that our feelings were
      irresistibly attracted towards him. In my case it proved to be mutual: he
      seemed to take the same interest in me, and we soon became bosom friends.
      A severe attack of congestive fever that I carried him through
      successfully, riveted him to me for ever; and Jerry, upon all and every
      occasion, stood ready to take up the gauntlet in my defence, as willingly
      as in his own. Being very popular in the neighbourhood, he became of great
      assistance to me, by advocating my cause, and extending, by his favourable
      representations, my circle of practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plantation adjoining Jerry's father's was possessed by an old,
      broken-down Virginian, who, having dissipated one fortune in conforming to
      the requirements of fashionable life, had come into the swamp, to endure
      its many privations, in order that he might recruit his impoverished
      finances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adversity, or something better, had taught him the folly of the prominent
      foible of the Virginian&mdash;insane state pride, and consequent
      individual importance. His mind was prepared to test men by the proper
      criterion&mdash;merit, without regard to the adventitious circumstances of
      birth, wealth, or nativity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Smith deserves the meed, I believe, for being the first one of the
      race to acknowledge that he was not an F. F.; which confession, showing
      his integrity of character, proved to me that he really was one of the
      very first of the land. But, in describing the father, I am neglecting by
      far the most interesting, if not the most important character of the story&mdash;his
      daughter&mdash;a sweet blooming girl of seventeen, at the time of which I
      write. Ah! she was the bright exemplar of her sex! Look in her eye&mdash;so
      luminous, yet so tender, and far down in its dreamy still waters, you
      could see the gems of purity and feeling glimmering; listen to her voice&mdash;and
      never yet forest bird, on the topmost leafy bough, gave forth such a gush
      of melody, as when it rose and melted away in a laugh; her modesty and
      timidity&mdash;you have seen the wild fawn, when, pausing on the brink of
      some placid lake, it sees its beautiful image reflected in the waters&mdash;thus
      shrank she, as if into herself, when voice of love, or praise, or
      admiration stole into her ears&mdash;and yet, with all her maidenly
      reserve and timidity, she loved and was beloved. Knowing that I am a
      bachelor, think not, in this recital, that my swelling heart is tearing
      open anew wounds which time and philosophy have just enabled me to heal.
      No! my fair friend&mdash;for friend she was, and is&mdash;never kindled in
      my heart the flames of love, or heard aught of the soft impeachment from
      me; for, long before I had seen her, the &ldquo;Swamp Doctor&rdquo; had wedded his
      books and calling&mdash;rather a frigid bride, but not an unprolific one,
      and her yearly increase, instead of bringing lines of anxiety to my brow,
      smooths the wrinkles that care and deep thought&mdash;certainly it cannot
      be age&mdash;Lord! Lord! I have broken my wig spring&mdash;have dropped
      upon my visage!
    </p>
    <p>
      My friend Jerry was the favoured mortal, and, without doubt, in an equal
      intensity reciprocated her love; but cowardice had hitherto prevented an
      avowal upon his part, and the two lovers, therefore, dwelt in a delicious
      state of uncertainty and suspense. No one, to know Jerry, as the majority
      of men&mdash;going through the world with their noses either too elevated
      or too depressed for observation&mdash;know their kind, would have thought
      him a coward: but I knew, that, as respected women, a more arrant poltroon
      did not exist. He would have met any peril that resolution, strength, or a
      contempt for life could overcome, without fear of the consequences or the
      least tremor; and yet he dared not for his life tell a pretty girl &ldquo;that
      he loved her, and would be highly pleased, and sorter tickled, too, if she
      would marry him.&rdquo; There was something more terrible in the idea of such an
      avowal, than fighting bears, hugging Indians, or strangling panthers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor girl, with the intuitive perception of her sex, had long
      perceived that Jerry loved her as ardently as if the avowal on his part
      had already been made. Almost daily she saw him, eagerly she awaited a
      declaration, but poor Jerry never could get his courage to the sticking
      point; like Bob Acres, it would ooze out at his fingers' points, in spite
      of himself and his determination to bring things to the condition of a
      fixed fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matters were in this state when I became fully acquainted with them; she
      was willing, he was willing, and yet, if they kept on in the way they were
      pursuing, they both bid fair to remain in single blessedness for a long
      time to come. Deeply interested in the welfare of both parties, I thought
      I could not manifest my sympathy better than by kindly intervening and
      producing that crisis which I knew would accord with the feelings of both.
    </p>
    <p>
      A slight attack of fever of the lady's, not requiring medical aid, but
      which a father's fears magnified, and would not be allayed until I had
      been sent for, introduced me fully to the confidence of the daughter; and
      a trite experiment, which I tried upon her, convinced me that all that my
      friend Jerry had to do was to ask, and it would be given.
    </p>
    <p>
      Holding my fair patient's hand, which, resting in mine, looked like a
      pearl in a setting of jet, I placed my fingers upon her pulse, and, whilst
      pretending to number it, accidentally, as it were, mentioned Jerry's name&mdash;the
      sudden thrill that pervaded the artery assured me that she loved&mdash;lifting
      my eyes to her face, I gave her an expressive look, which suffused her
      beauteous countenance, as if she was passing into the second stage of
      scarlet fever.
    </p>
    <p>
      My next duty was to seek Jerry. I found him seated on a log, under a shady
      willow by the edge of the bayou, pole in hand, assuming to be angling. The
      tense state of his line, and an occasional quiver of the pole, indicated
      that a fish was hooked. Passing unnoticed by him, a stranger would have
      come to one of three conclusions: that he was deranged, in love, or a born
      fool.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walking up to him briskly, without his hearing me, although I made
      considerable noise getting down the bank, I slapped him on the shoulder to
      engage his attention, and, as I had several patients to visit, and time
      was precious, without waiting for the usual salutations of the day.
      commenced my address in a real quarter race manner:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jerry, for a sensible man, and a fellow of courage, you are the d&mdash;&mdash;dest
      fool and coward unhung. You love a girl&mdash;the girl loves you. You know
      that the old people are willing, and that the girl is only waiting for you
      to pop the question, to say 'Yes!' and yet, instead of having the thing
      over, like white folks, and becoming the head of a respectable family,
      here you sit, like a knot on a tree, with the moss commencing to grow on
      your back, pretending to be fishing, and yet not knowing that a big cat is
      almost breaking your line to shivers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I want to do you a service, and you must take my advice. Jerk that
      fish out, take the hook out of his mouth, and then put him back in the
      bayou&mdash;perhaps his sweetheart was waiting for him when he got hung;
      and as you are in a like predicament, you should be able to say to the
      gal, 'That mercy I to others show, that mercy show to me!' Go home, put on
      a clean shirt, shave that hair off your face and upper lip; for a sensible
      woman never yet accepted a man, with nothing but the tip of his nose
      visible from its wilderness of hair. Dress yourself decently, go up to old
      Smith's, wait till you get rested, then ask the girl to take a walk in the
      garden&mdash;gardens are a h&mdash;ll of a place to make love in&mdash;to
      look at the flowers, to eat radishes, to pluck grapes&mdash;anything for
      an excuse to get her there&mdash;and when you have got her under the
      arbour, don't fall on your knees, or any of your fool novel notions, but
      stand straight up before her, take both of her hands in yours, look her
      dead in the eyes, and ask her, in a bold, manly way&mdash;as if you were
      pricing pork&mdash;to marry you. Will you do it? Speak quick! I'm
      interested in the matter, for if you don't do it to-day, by the Lord, I
      will, for myself, to morrow. I have held off for you long enough; and if
      you don't bring matters to a close, as I say, in the next twenty-four
      hours, as cold weather is coming on, I'll try my hand myself in the
      courting line&mdash;you know doctors are the very devil amongst the
      women!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This method of address alarmed Jerry, and he promised he would do as I
      directed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accompanying him home, I saw him fairly dressed, and then left him, as the
      demands of my patients were urgent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jerry mounted his steed, and set off at a brisk canter for Major Smith's.
      It was only a mile and a half, and would have been travelled in a quarter
      of an hour, had the steed kept his' gait. But, somehow, as the distance
      shortened, the canter ceased, and a pace superseded it; the last half, his
      rate had moderated to a walk; and when he made the last turn in the road,
      his horse was browsing the grass and cane. Up to the last few hundred
      yards, Jerry was as brave as a panther with cubs, and determined on
      following out my prescription to the letter; but the moment the house,
      with its white chimneys, commenced appearing round the bend of the bayou,
      the white pin feathers began to peep out in his heart, and verily,
      nothing, I believe, but my threat, if he proved recreant to-day, of
      courting her myself on the morrow, kept him from giving up the chase, and
      retracing his steps home.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the house was reached, and the hearty voice of the Major, bidding him
      alight, cut off all retreat. He was fairly in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jerry got down, left the yard gate carefully open behind him, led his
      horse up the Major's fine grass-walk to the steps, and was about bringing
      him with him into the house, when a servant relieved him of the task by
      carrying the steed to the stable. Not noticing the air of astonishment
      with which the old Major was regarding him, he shook hands with the negro
      for Major Smith, and bowing to a large yellow water-jar, addressed it as
      &ldquo;Miss Mary,&rdquo; and then finished the performances by sitting down in a large
      basket of eggs; the sudden yielding of his seat, and the laughter of both
      father and daughter, aroused him to a full consciousness of how
      ridiculously he was acting. His apologies and explanations only served to
      render bad worse, and he therefore wisely determined to take a chair and
      say nothing more. Dinner was shortly announced, and this he concluded in
      very respectable style, without making any more serious mistake than
      eating cabbage with a spoon, or helping the lady to the drum-stick of the
      chicken. A cigar was smoked after dinner, and then the old Major, giving a
      shrewd guess how the land lay, declared that he must take his afternoon
      nap, and retired, leaving the field to Jerry and the daughter. &ldquo;Now or
      never,&rdquo; was the motto with Jerry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old Major, in addition to planting cotton, and retrieving a dissipated
      fortune, was a great dabbler in horticulture, and had bestowed great
      attention upon the cultivation of the grape. By much care and grafting, he
      had so improved upon the common varieties of the country as to render them
      but slightly inferior to the choicest foreign specimens. An extensive
      arbour was in the middle of the garden&mdash;the finest and most extensive
      in the swamp&mdash;and this was literally covered with the ruddy clusters
      of grapes, now in the fullest tide of ripeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now or never,&rdquo; I say, was the word with Jerry. Making a desperate effort,
      he faltered out, &ldquo;Miss Mary, your father has a very fine garden! shall we
      go look at the grapes? I am very fond of them, Miss Mary! do you like
      grapes, Miss Mary? Ha! ha!&rdquo;&mdash;the cold sweat bursting out from every
      pore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very much, Mr. Wilson, and pa's are really very fine, considering that
      they have not the quality of being exotics to recommend them to our taste.
      I will accompany you to taste them with much pleasure,&rdquo; replied Miss Mary;
      and tripping into the house, soon appeared, with the sweetest little
      sun-bonnet on, that witching damsel ever wore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jerry, frightened nearly to death at the awful propinquity of the
      &ldquo;question popping,&rdquo; could scarcely stand, for his agitation; and poor Miss
      Mary, apprehending from Jerry's manner that the garden was destined to
      become the recipient of some awfully horrible avowal&mdash;perhaps Jerry
      had murdered somebody, and his conscience was forcing him to disclose; or
      he had discovered that an insurrection of the negroes was contemplated; or&mdash;surely
      he was not going to make a declaration&mdash;oh, no! she knew it was not
      anything of that kind&mdash;began to participate in Jerry's embarrassment
      and trepidation. More like criminals proceeding to execution, than young
      people going to pluck grapes, they sought the garden; the gate was closed
      behind them, and in a few moments more they stood under the arbour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grapes were hanging down upon all sides in the greatest profusion;
      and, twining their purple masses together, seemingly cried out, &ldquo;Come eat
      us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jerry was the very picture of terror. Oh! how he wished that he was safe
      at home! But it was too late to retreat&mdash;he could only procrastinate.
      But still, men had gone as far as walking in a secluded garden with a
      lady, and then died old bachelors. But then that infernal doctor to-morrow&mdash;the
      die was cast, he would go on. The question was, how should he approach the
      subject, so as not to destroy life in the young lady, when the dreadful
      business of his visit was announced? He must prepare her for it gradually&mdash;the
      grapes offered an introductory&mdash;the impolite fellow, not to offer her
      any during the long time they had been in the arbour&mdash;they had just a
      second before reached it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plucking off a large bunch, he handed them to her, and selected a similar
      one for himself. They were devoured in silence, Jerry too badly frightened
      to speak, and Mary wondering what in the world was to come next. The
      grapes were consumed, another pair of bunches selected, and the sound of
      their champing jaws was all that broke the stillness. Jerry's eyes were
      fixed on his bunch, and Mary was watching the motions of an agile snail.
      The cluster was in process of disappearance, when Jerry, summoning his
      whole energies, commenced his declamation: &ldquo;Miss Mary, I have something to
      impart&rdquo;&mdash;here he came to a full stop, and looked up, as if to draw
      inspiration from heaven; but the umbrageous foliage intercepted his view,
      and only the grapes met his eye&mdash;and their juice requires to be gone
      through with several processes, before much exhilaration or eloquence can
      be drawn from it. Plucking a quantity, he swallowed them, to relieve his
      throat, which was becoming strangely dry and harsh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mary, poor girl, was sitting there, very much confused, busily eating
      grapes; neither she nor Jerry knew, whilst continuing to eat, the quantity
      that they had consumed: their thoughts were elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Mary,&rdquo; again upspoke Jerry, &ldquo;you must have seen long before this&mdash;but
      la! your bunch is eaten&mdash;have some more grapes, Miss Mary? I like
      them very much&rdquo;&mdash;and amidst much snubbling and champing, another
      package of grapes was warehoused by the lovers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jerry's fix was becoming desperate; time was flying rapidly, and he knew
      one subject would soon be exhausted, for he could eat but few more grapes.
      Oh! how he wished that fighting a panther, fist-fight, had been made one
      of the conventialities of society, and assumed to be declaratory of the
      soft passion! how quickly would his bride be wooed!&mdash;but those
      infernal words! he could never arrange them so as to express what he
      meant. &ldquo;Miss Mary, you must know that I saw Dr. Tensas, to-day, he told me&mdash;have
      some more, Miss Mary, they won't hurt you. I have come expressly to ask
      you&mdash;have another bunch, let me insist. I have come, Miss Mary, to
      propose&mdash;another small bunch&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Mary, I have come,&rdquo; he almost
      shrieked, &ldquo;to ask you to have&mdash;only a few more&mdash;Oh! Lord!&rdquo; and
      he wiped the cold sweat off. Poor fellow! his pluck would not hold out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary, frightened at his vehemence, said nothing, but eat on mechanically,
      anxious to hear what it was that Jerry wished to disclose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again he marshalled his forces: the sun was declining in the west, and the
      morrow would, perhaps, see the &ldquo;Swamp Doctor,&rdquo; with his glib tongue,
      breathing his vows&mdash;&ldquo;Miss Mary, I&mdash;I love&mdash;grapes&mdash;no,
      you&mdash;grapes&mdash;will you have me&mdash;some grapes&mdash;marry me&mdash;no
      grapes&mdash;yes, me! Oh! Lord! it is all over! You will&mdash;bless you&mdash;I
      must have a kiss. You haven't consented yet&mdash;but you must!&rdquo; The
      barrier seemed to drop, the spell was lifted off his tongue, and Jerry, in
      a stream of native eloquence, running the fiercer for being so long pent
      up, plead his cause; could it be unsuccessful? Oh! no! Mary had made up
      her mind long ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      Side by side, now, all their diffidence vanished; they sat under the
      blessed arbour, and discoursed of their past fears, and bright hopes for
      the future! Jerry held the head of his mistress on his leal and noble
      breast, and, as in a sweet and pure strain he pictured forth the quiet
      domestic life they were to lead when married, Mary could scarcely believe
      that the impudent fellow who now talked so glibly, and stole, in spite of
      her rebukes, kisses unnumbered, was the timid nervous swain of a few
      minutes before.
    </p>
    <p>
      But lo! behold what a sudden transformation! Has Jerry struck some
      discordant note in his sweet melody of the future&mdash;for Mary's
      features are contracted, as if with pain, and her pretty face, in spite of
      herself, wears a vinegar aspect. Rather early, I opine, for ladies to
      commence the shrew&mdash;if I am wrong, lady reader, attribute the error
      to the ignorance of an old bachelor. Jerry, too, seems to partake of the
      sour contagion&mdash;he stamps upon the ground, writhes his body about,
      and presses his hand upon his stomach, ignorant, I presume, of anatomy. He
      meant to lay them over his heart, poor fellow! he got too Jow down. Mary,
      too, is evincing the ardency of her affection; and with the same
      deplorable ignorance of the locality of the organs. Verily, love is
      affecting them, singularly. It may be a pleasant passion, but that couple,
      who certainly have a fresh, I will not say genuine, article of lo\e, look
      like anything but happy accepted lovers. What can be the matter? They have
      just read an extract from one of Cowper's bu-<i>colics</i>&mdash;but can
      poetry produce such an effect? They groan, and writhe their bodies about,
      and would press their hearts, if they only lay where their digestive
      apparatus certainly does. Can the grapes have anything to do with their
      queer contortions? &ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; Jerry cries, as a horrid suspicion flashes
      over his mind, &ldquo;The cholera! The cholera! Dearest, we will die together,
      locked in each other's arms!&rdquo; and Jerry sought to embrace his lady love;
      but she was <i>scrouched up</i>, I believe the ladies term it, and as lie
      had assumed the same globular position, approximation could not be
      effected, and death had acquired another pang, from their having to meet
      him separate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately for them, the Major had got his sleep out some hours before,
      and, becoming anxious at their prolonged stay, set out to seek them. As
      the garden was a quiet, secluded place, he thought them most likely to be
      there, and there he found them, labouring under the influence, not so much
      of love as&mdash;the truth must out&mdash;an overdose of grapes: and you
      know how they affect the system.
    </p>
    <p>
      A boy was despatched post haste after me. Fortunately I was at home, and
      quickly reached the spot. I reached the house, and was introduced
      immediately to the apartment where both the patients lay. A glance at
      their condition and position explained the cause fully of their disease. A
      hearty emetic effected a cure; and the first child of Jerry and Mary
      Wilson was distinctly marked on the left shoulder with a bunch of grapes.

    <h2>
      HOW TO CURE FITS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>ot none of the
      least difficult problems, in the practice of medicine, is the
      distinguishing between cases of real disease, and those that are feigned.
      It is a great stumbling block in the path of young practitioners, and even
      the old members of the fraternity find a few chips of it in their way
      occasionally. To such a degree may the art of dissimulation be carried,
      that nothing but the eye of suspicion and blind presentiment will lead us
      to detect the imposition. I have known a case of simulated disease, after
      deceiving some of the first physicians in the South, and withstanding
      almost every species of treatment, to be cured by an energetic, liberal
      administration of the negro-whip. But this is a remedy that fearful
      humanity will not allow us to use, and consequently I never resort to it,
      but use equally as effective, but uninjurious means.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly after I commenced practice, I was sent for in a great hurry to see
      a case of fits in the person of a negro wench, belonging to a plantation a
      few miles from where I was located. The fit was over when I reached the
      place, and I found the patient resting very composedly and showing no
      evidence of present or past disease; but the testimony of her master went
      to show that she had had one of the worst fits he had ever seen, and he
      ought to know something about fits, as he had lived several years in
      Arkansas, where the doctors invariably throw every case into fits as
      preliminary to a cure.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made a prescription suitable to his description, and returned home, only
      to be sent for in greater haste the next day, and so on every day for a
      week, the fits seeming to increase in intensity under my treatment. I
      remarked, as a peculiarity of her case, that on Sundays, and when rain
      prevented her being put out to work, she escaped the attack; but hardly
      could the hoe-handle salute her palm in the cotton-field, before she would
      be screeching, yelping, and struggling like a friend of mine, who, camping
      out, made his pillow of a fallen, but still tenanted hornets' nest.
    </p>
    <p>
      I became desperate; the owner was becoming tired of sending for me, and my
      reputation was suffering, for the patient was getting worse. I examined
      her again thoroughly, but nothing could I find in her digestive, arterial,
      nervous, muscular, or osseous systems, to indicate disease. I shaved all
      the wool off her head to feel for depressed skull-bones, and commencing
      the Materia Medica at Acetic Acid, administered through to Zingiber,
      concluding the course by knocking her senseless with a galvanic battery;
      but she stood fits, treatment, and everything else without change, and not
      till a strong impression rested on my mind that she was feigning, did a
      different course of treatment suggest itself to me. The plantation lay on
      both sides of a deep bayou, the link of connexion a high wooden bridge. I
      happened in one day at the house, when I perceived four negroes
      approaching the bridge from the opposite field, bearing some object in a
      blanket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding, on inquiry, that my patient had that morning started to work in
      that part of the plantation, I readily surmised that the blanket aforesaid
      contained my case of fits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Asking the overseer to accompany me, we advanced to meet the negroes, who
      seemed to have great difficulty in keeping the object in the blanket; we
      met them just as they reached the centre of the bridge, the water under
      neath being some eight or ten feet deep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who have you got there?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hannah, sir, has got another of her fits,&rdquo; replied one of the negroes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put her down on the bridge and let me examine her.&rdquo; It was done; it
      required the united strength of the four negroes to hold her still whilst
      I made the necessary examination, the result of which confirmed my
      impression that she was simulating. I thundered almost in her ears, but
      she gave no answer, and I determined to put in execution my new plan of
      treatment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pick her up and throw her in the bayou,&rdquo; I said, very clearly and
      precisely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Knowing I rarely said what I did not mean, the negroes yet hesitated
      somewhat at the singular command, afraid either to obey or refuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Throw her in!&rdquo; I yelled, giving a thundering stamp on the bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      No longer in doubt, the negroes picked up the blanket, and giving it a few
      preliminary swings, to acquire momentum, were about to cast away, when,
      with a loud yell, the case of fits burst from their hold and made tracks
      for the cotton-field. I am pretty fleet myself, as were the negroes, but
      that <i>poor diseased invalid</i> beat us all, and had hoed considerably
      on a row before we reached her. A liberal flagellation completed the cure,
      and she has never been troubled with fits since!

    <h2>
      A STRUGGLE FOR LIFE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was the spring
      of 183-, the water from the Mississippi had commenced overflowing the low
      swamps, and rendering travelling on horseback very disagreeable. The water
      had got to that troublesome height, when it was rather too high for a
      horse, and not high enough for a canoe or skiff to pass easily over the
      submerged grounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was sitting out under my favourite oak, congratulating myself that I had
      no travelling to do just then,&mdash;it was very healthy&mdash;when my joy
      was suddenly nipped in the bud by a loud hallo from the opposite side of
      the bayou. Looking over, and answering the hail, I discerned first a mule,
      and then something which so closely resembled an ape or an ourang outang,
      that I was in doubt whether the voice had proceeded from it, until a
      repetition of the hail, this time coming unmistakeably from it, assured me
      that it was a human.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Massa doctor at home?&rdquo; yelled the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am the doctor; what do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Massa sent me with a letter to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jumping in the skiff, a few vigorous strokes sent me to the opposite
      shore, where the singular being awaited my coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a negro dwarf of the most frightful appearance; his diminutive body
      was garnished with legs and arms of enormously disproportionate length;
      his face was hideous: a pair of tushes projected from either side of a
      double hare-lip; and taking him altogether, he was the nearest essemblance
      to the ourang outang mixed with the devil that human eyes ever dwelt upon.
      I could not look at him without feeling disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Massa Bill sent me with a letter,&rdquo; was his reply to my asking him his
      business.
    </p>
    <p>
      Opening it, I found a summons to see a patient, the mother of a man named
      Disney, living some twenty miles distant by the usual road. It was in no
      good humour that I told the dwarf to wait until I could swim my horse
      over, and I would accompany him.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time I had concluded my preparations, and put a large bottle of
      brandy in my pocket, my steed was awaiting me upon the opposite shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Massa tole me to tell you ef you didn't mine swimming a little you had
      better kum de nere way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you have to swim much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, massa, onely swim Plurisy Lake, and wade de back water a few mile,
      you'll save haf de way at leste.&rdquo; I looked at the sun. It was only about
      two hours high, and the roads were in such miserable condition that six
      miles an hour would be making fine speed, so I determined to go the near
      way, and swim &ldquo;Pleurisy slough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are certain you know the road, boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, massa, me know um ebery inch ob de groun'; hunted possum an'
      coon ober him many a night. Massa, you ain't got any 'baccy, is you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a chaw&mdash;and here's a drink of brandy. I'll give you another
      if you pilot me safe through, and a good pounding if you get lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dank you, Massa, um's good. No fere I lose you, know ebery inch of de
      groun'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had poured him out a dram, not considering his diminutive stature,
      sufficient to unsettle the nerves of a stout man, but he drank it off with
      great apparent relish; and by this time, everything being ready, we
      commenced ploughing our way through the muddy roads.
    </p>
    <p>
      We made but slow progress. I would dash on, and then have to wait for the
      dwarf, who, belabouring his mule with a cudgel almost as large as himself,
      strove in vain to keep up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The road was directly down the bayou, for some miles. There were few
      settlers on it then, and the extent of their clearing consisted of a
      corn-patch. They were the pre-emptioners or squatters; men who settled
      upon government land before its survey, and awaited the incoming of
      planters with several negroes to buy their claims, themselves to be bought
      out by more affluent emigrants. To one of the first-mentioned class&mdash;the
      pre-emptioners&mdash;my visit was directed, or rather to his mother, who
      occupied an intermediate grade between the squatter and the small planter,
      inasmuch as she possessed one negro, the delectable morsel for whom I was
      waiting every few hundred yards.
    </p>
    <p>
      It wanted but an hour to sundown when we reached the place where it was
      optional with me, either to go the longer route by the bayou, or save
      several miles by cutting across the bend of the stream, having, however,
      to swim &ldquo;Pleurisy slough&rdquo; if I did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      The path across was quite obscure, and it would be dark by the time we
      crossed; but the negro declared he knew every inch of the way, and as
      saving distance was a serious consideration, I determined to try it and
      &ldquo;Pleurisy slough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Taking a drink to warm me, for the dew that had commenced to fall was
      quite chilling, I gave one to the negro, not noticing the wild sparkle of
      his eye or the exhilaration of his manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      We pressed on eagerly, I ahead as long as the path lasted; but it giving
      out at the edge of the back water, it became necessary for the negro to
      precede and pilot the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      I followed him mechanically for some distance, relying on his intimate
      knowledge of the swamp, our steeds making but slow progress through the
      mud and water.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we entered the swamp I had remarked that the sun was in our faces;
      and great was my astonishment, when we had travelled some time, on
      glancing my eye upwards to see if it had left the tree-tops, to perceive
      its last beams directly at my back, the very reverse of what it should
      have been. Thinking perhaps that it was some optical illusion, I consulted
      the moss on the trees, and its indication was that we were taking the back
      track. I addressed the negro very sharply for having misled me, when,
      instead of excusing himself, he turned on me his hideous countenance and
      chuckled the low laugh of drunkenness. I saw that I had given him too much
      brandy for his weak brain, and that he was too far gone to be of any
      assistance to me in finding the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mine was a pleasant situation truly. To return home would be as bad as to
      endeavour to go on; it would be night at any rate before I could get out
      of the swamp; and after it fell, as there was no moon, it would be
      dangerous to travel, as the whole country was full of lakes and sloughs,
      and we might be precipitated suddenly into one of them, losing our animals
      if not being drowned ourselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was evident that I would have to pass the night in the swamp, my only
      companion the drunken dwarf. I had nothing to eat, and no weapons to
      protect myself if assailed by wild beasts; but the swamp was high enough
      to preclude the attack of anything but an alligator, and their bellow was
      resounding in too close proximity to be agreeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, being a cigar-smoker, I had a box of matches in my pocket, so
      I would have a fire at least. My next care was to find a ridge
      sufficiently above the water to furnish a dry place for building a fire
      and camp. After considerable search, just at night-fall the welcome
      prospect of a cane ridge above the overflow met my gaze; hurrying up the
      negro, who by this time was maudlin drunk, I reached the cane, and forcing
      my way with considerable difficulty through it until I got out of the
      reach of the water, dismounted, and tying my horse, took the negro down
      and performed the same office for his mule.
    </p>
    <p>
      My next care was to gather materials for a fire before impenetrable
      darkness closed over the swamp; fortunately for me, a fallen oak presented
      itself not ten steps from where I stood. To have a cheerful blazing fire
      was the work of a few minutes. Breaking off sufficient cane-tops to last
      the steeds till morning, I stripped my horse&mdash;the mule had nothing on
      but a bridle&mdash;and with the saddle and cane-leaves made me a couch
      that a monarch, had he been as tired as I was, would have found no fault
      with. As the negro was perfectly helpless, and nearly naked, I gave him my
      saddle blanket, and making him a bed at a respectful distance, bade him go
      to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Replenishing the fire with sufficient fuel to last till morning, I lit a
      cigar, and throwing myself down upon my fragrant couch, gave myself up to
      reflections upon the peculiarity of my situation. Had it been a voluntary
      bivouac with a set of chosen companions, it would not have awakened half
      the interest in my mind that it did, for the attending circumstances
      imparted to it much of the romantic.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, far from human habitation, my only companion a hideous dwarf,
      surrounded with water, the night drape-ried darkly around, I lay, the
      cane-leaves for my bed, the saddle for my pillow; the huge fire lighting
      up the darkness for a space around, and giving natural objects a strange,
      distorted appearance, bringing the two steeds into high relief against the
      dark background of waving cane, which nodded over, discoursing a wild,
      peculiar melody of its own. Occasionally a loud explosion would be heard
      as the fire communicated with a green reed; the wild hoot of an owl was
      heard, and directly I almost felt the sweep of his wings as he went
      sailing by, and alighted upon an old tree just where the light sank
      mingling with the darkness. I followed him with my eye, and as he settled
      himself, he turned his gaze towards me; I moved one of the logs, and his
      huge eyes fairly glistened with light, as the flames shot up with
      increased vigour; the swamp moss was flowing around him in long, tangled
      masses, and as a more vivid gleam uprose, I gazed and started
      involuntarily. Had I not known it was an owl surrounded with moss that sat
      upon that stricken tree, I would have sworn it was the form of an old man,
      clad in a sombre flowing mantle, his arm raised in an attitude of warning,
      that I gazed upon. A cane exploding, startled the owl, and with a loud &ldquo;tu
      whit, tu whoo,&rdquo; he went sailing away in the darkness. The unmelodious
      bellow of the alligator, and the jarring cry of the heron, arose from a
      lake on the opposite side of the cane; whilst the voices of a myriad of
      frogs, and the many undistinguish-able sounds of the swamp, made the night
      vocal with discordancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      My cigar being by this time exhausted, I took the bottle from my pocket,
      and taking a hearty drink to keep the night air from chilling me when
      asleep, was about to restore it to its place, and commend myself to
      slumber, when, glancing at the dwarf, I saw his eyes fixed upon me with a
      demoniac expression that I shall never forget.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me a dram,&rdquo; he said very abruptly, not prefacing the request by
      those deferential words never omitted by the slave when in his proper
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, you have already taken too much; I will give you no more,&rdquo; I
      replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me a dram,&rdquo; he again said, more fiercely than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Breaking off a cane, I told him that if he spoke to me in that manner
      again I would give him a severe flogging.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to my surprise he retorted, &ldquo;D&mdash;&mdash;n you, white man, I will
      kill you ef you don't give me more brandy!&rdquo; his eyes flashing and
      sparkling with electric light.
    </p>
    <p>
      I rose to correct him, but a comparison of my well developed frame with
      his stunted deformed proportions, and the reflection that his drunkenness
      was attributable to my giving him the brandy, deterred me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will kill you,&rdquo; he again screamed, his fangs clashing, and the foam
      flying from his mouth, his long arms extended as if to clutch me, and the
      fingers quivering nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took a hasty glance of my condition. I was lost in the midst of the
      swamp, an unknown watery expanse surrounding me; remote from any possible
      assistance; the swamps were rapidly filling with water, and if we did not
      get out to-morrow or next day, we would in all probability be starved or
      drowned; the negro was my only dependence, to pilot me to the settlements,
      and he was threatening my life if I did not give him more brandy; should I
      do it or not? Judging from the effects of the two drinks I had given him,
      if he got possession of the bottle it might destroy him, or at least
      render him incapable of travelling, until starvation and exposure would
      destroy us. My mind was resolved upon that subject; I would give him no
      more. There was no alternative, I would have to stand his assault;
      considering I was three times his size, a fearful adventure, truly,
      thought I, not doubting a moment but that my greater size would give me
      proportionate strength; I must not hurt him, but will tie him until he
      recovers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dwarf, now aroused to maniacal fury by the persistance in my refusal,
      slowly approached me to carry his threat into execution. The idea of such
      a diminutive object destroying without weapons a man of my size, presented
      something ludicrous, and I laughingly awaited his attack, ready to tie his
      hands before he could bite or scratch me. Wofully I underrated his powers!

    <p>
      With a yell like a wild beast's, he precipitated himself upon me; evading
      my blow, he clutched with his long fingers at my throat, burying his
      talons in my flesh, and writhing his little body around mine, strove to
      bear me to earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      I summoned my whole strength, and endeavoured to shake him off; but,
      possessing the proverbial power of the dwarf, increased by his drunken
      mania to an immense degree, I found all my efforts unavailing, and, oh
      God! horrors of horrors, what awful anguish was mine, when I found him
      bearing me slowly to earth, and his piercing talons buried in my throat,
      cutting off my breath! My eyes met his with a more horrid gleam than that
      he glared upon me: his was the fire of brutal nature, aroused by desire to
      intense malignancy; and mine the gaze of despair and death. Closer and
      firmer his gripe closed upon my throat, barring out the sweet life's
      breath. I strove to shriek for help, but could not. How shall I describe
      the racking agony that tortured me? A mountain, heavier than any earth's
      bosom holds, was pressing upon my breast, slowly crushing me to fragments.
      All kinds of colours first floated before my eyes, and then everything
      wore a settled, intensely fiery red. I felt my jaw slowly dropping, and my
      tongue protruding, till it rested on the hellish fangs that encircled my
      throat. I could hear distinctly every pulsation of even the minutest
      artery in my frame. Its wild singing was in my ears like the ocean wave
      playing over the shell-clad shore. I remember it all perfectly, for the
      mind, through all this awful struggle, still remained full of thought and
      clearness. Closer grew the gripe of those talons around my throat, and I
      knew that I could live but a few moments more. I did not pray. I did not
      commend my soul to God. I had not a fear of death. But oh! awful were my
      thoughts at dying in such a way&mdash;suffocated by a hellish negro in the
      midst of the noisome swamp, my flesh to be devoured by the carrion crow,
      my bones to whiten where they lay for long years, and then startle the
      settler, when civilization had strode into the wilderness, and the cane
      that would conceal my bones would be falling before the knife of the
      cane-cutter. I ceased to breathe. I was dead. I had suffered the last
      pangs of that awful hour, and either it was the soul not yet resigned to
      leave its human tenement, or else immortal mind triumphing over death, but
      I still retained the sentient principle within my corpse. I remember
      distinctly when the demon relaxed his clutch, and shaking me to see if I
      were really dead, broke into a hellish laugh. I remember distinctly when
      tearing the bottle from me, he pulled my limber body off my couch, and
      stretched himself upon it. And what were my thoughts? I was dead, yet am
      living now. Ay, dead as human ever becomes. My lungs had ceased to play;
      my heart was still; my muscles were inactive; even my skin had the dead
      clammy touch. Had men been there, they would have placed me in a coffin,
      and buried me deep in the ground, and the worm would have eaten me, and
      the death-rats made nests in my heart, and what was lately a strong man
      would have become a loathsome mass. But still in that coffin amidst those
      writhing worms, would have been the immortal mind, and still would it have
      thought and pondered on till the last day was come. For such, is the
      course of soul and death, as my interpretation has it. I was dead, all but
      my mind, and that still thought on as vividly, as ramblingly, as during
      life. My body lay dead in that murderer's swamp, my mind roamed far away
      in thought, reviewing my carnal life. I stood, as when a boy, by my
      mother's grave. The tall grass was waving over it, the green sod smiled at
      my feet. &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; I whispered, &ldquo;your child is weary&mdash;the world looks
      harsh upon him&mdash;coldness comes from those who should shelter the
      orphan. Mother, open your large black eyes and smile upon your child.&rdquo;
       Again, I stood upon the steamer, a childish fugitive, giving a last look
      upon my fleeing home, and mingling my tears with the foaming wave beneath.
      I dragged my exhausted frame through the cotton-fields of the south. My
      back was wearied with stooping&mdash;we were picking the first opening&mdash;and
      as dreams of future distinction would break upon my soul, the strap of the
      cotton-sack, galling my shoulder, recalled me to myself. All the phases of
      my life were repeated, until they ended where I lay dead!&mdash;dead as
      mortal ever becomes. I thought, What will my friends say when they hear
      that on a visit to the sick, I disappeared in the swamp, and was never
      heard of more?&mdash;drowned or starved to death? Will they weep for me?
      for me?&mdash;Not many, I ween, will be the tears that will be shed for
      me. Then, after the lapse of long years, my bones will be found. I wonder
      who will get my skull? Perhaps an humble doctor like myself, who,
      meditating upon it, will not think that it holds the mind of a creature of
      his own ambition&mdash;his own lofty instincts. He will deem it but an
      empty skull, and little dream that it held a sentient principle. But I
      know that the mind will still tenant it. Ha, ha! how that foul ape is
      gurgling his blood-bought pleasure. I would move if I could, and wrench
      the bottle from him; but mine is thought, not action. Hark! there is a
      storm arising. I hear with my ear, that is pressed on the earth, the
      thunder of the hurricane. How the trees crash beneath it! Will it
      prostrate those above me? Hark! what awful thunder! Ah me! what fierce
      pang is that piercing my very vitals? There is a glimmering of light
      before my eyes. Can it be that I the dead am being restored to human life?
      Another thunder peal! 'tis the second stroke of my heart&mdash;my blood is
      red-hot&mdash;it comes with fire through my veins&mdash;the earth quakes&mdash;the
      mountain is rolling off my chest&mdash;I live!&mdash;I breathe!&mdash;I
      see!&mdash;I hear!&mdash;Where am I? Who brought me here? I hear other
      sounds, but cannot my own voice. Where am I? Ah! I remember the dwarf
      strangled me. Hark! where is he? Is that the sunbeam playing over the
      trees? What noisome odour like consuming flesh is that which poisons the
      gale? Great God! can that disfigured half-consumed mass be my evil genius?
    </p>
    <p>
      I rose up, and staggering, fell again; my strength was nearly gone. I lay
      until I thought myself sufficiently recruited to stand, and then got up
      and surveyed the scene. The animals were tied as I left them, and were
      eating their cane unconcernedly; but fearfully my well-nigh murderer had
      paid for his crime, and awful was the retribution Maddened by the spirits,
      he had rushed into the flames, and, in the charred and loathsome mass,
      nothing of the human remained; he had died the murderer's death and been
      buried in his grave,&mdash;a tomb of fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      To remain longer in the horrid place was impossible; my throat pained me
      excessively where the talons had penetrated the flesh, and I could not
      speak above a whisper. I turned the mule loose, thinking that it would
      return home, and conduct me out of the swamp. I was not incorrect in my
      supposition; the creature led me to his owner's cabin. The patient had
      died during the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      My account of the dwarf's attack did not surprise the family; he had once,
      when in a similar condition, made an attack upon his mistress, and would
      have strangled her had assistance not been near.
    </p>
    <p>
      His bones were left to bleach where they lay. I would not for the universe
      have looked again upon the place; and his mistress being dead, there were
      none to care for giving him the rites of sepulture.

      Permit me, my friend, to dedicate to you these pages, the first production
      of my pen in the field of western literature, and allow me to say, that
      your own graphic relations of far-west scenes, witnessed when this now
      giant territory was in its infancy, has contributed much to illustrate for
      me the striking features of western character. You may be set down as one,
      who has not only been a dweller in the wilds since its primitive days, but
      an observer of its progress in every stage, from the semi-civilised state
      until the refinement of polished life has usurped the wilderness. Through
      this period of transition you have stood unchanged, and that generous and
      noble nature, which induced the Indian chieftain, in by-gone days, to
      style you as the &ldquo;Gray Eagle&rdquo; of the forest, calls forth this humble
      tribute of regard from your friend.

    <h2>
      PREFACE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> n offering the
      following sketches to the public, I feel somewhat like the hoosier
      candidate described his sensations, when he first essayed to deliver a <i>stump
      speech</i>: &ldquo;I felt,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that ef I could ony git the beginnin' out&mdash;ef
      I could ony say 'fellar citizens!' that arter that it 'ud go jest as easy
      as corn shuckin'!&rdquo; So with your humble servant, if this my first effort at
      book making should meet with favor, I feel that a second attempt would be
      a pleasing task. To all adventurers in the field of literature the
      slightest encouragement is a shower of success&mdash;in my own case a
      smile upon my effort will swell in my estimation to a downright &ldquo;snigger&rdquo;
       The commendation which was bestowed upon the sketch of &ldquo;Swallowing Oysters
      Alive,&rdquo; was some evidence that it tickled the public taste, and, of
      course, its wide approval tickled the fancy of the author; so if this
      collection be an infliction upon the reading public's taste, they have
      themselves to blame&mdash;they offered the temptation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is unnecessary for me to apologise for their style, for to pretend a
      capability to furnish any better, I don't&mdash;and their finish will be
      excused when I state, they are the productions of the few short hours
      outside of eight in the morning and ten at night, the time between being
      occupied by arduous duties which almost forbid thought, save of
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The west, abounds with incident and humor, and the observer must lack an
      eye for the comic who can look upon the panorama of western life without
      being tempted to laugh. It would indeed seem that the nearer sundown, the
      more original the character and odd the expression, as if the sun, with
      his departing beams, had shed a new feature upon the back-woods
      inhabitants. This oddity and originality has often attracted my attention
      and contributed to my amusement, and I have wondered why the finished and
      graphic writers of our country so seldom sought material from this
      inviting field. The idea of ever attempting to develope any portion of
      this mine of incident and character, with my feeble pen, has but recently
      been flattered into existence, and if my hasty efforts but aid to awaken
      attention and attract skilful pens to this original and striking field of
      literature, my highest ambition is attained. The amusing delineations of
      Thorpe, Hooper, Field, Sol Smith, and others, who have with abler pens
      developed these incidents of western life, and the avidity with which
      their sketches have been read, give assurance that the rivers and valleys
      of this western land will no longer be neglected. That it here abounds as
      plentiful as the minerals within its bosom, there is no question, for
      every step of the pioneer's progress has been marked with incidents,
      humorous and thrilling, which wait but the wizard spell of a bright mind
      and able pen to call them from misty tradition, and clothe them with
      speaking life.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is true there are dark streaks in western life, as well as light ones,
      as where in human society exists the one without the other; but, in their
      relation, the future historian of the wilds should be careful to
      distinguish between the actual settler and the <i>border harpy</i>. The
      acts of this latter class have often thrilled the refined mind with
      horror, and brought condemnation upon the pioneer, while a wide
      distinction exists between the two characters. The <i>harpy</i> is
      generally some worthless and criminal character, who, having to flee from
      more populous districts, seeks refuge at the outskirts of civilization,
      and there preys alike upon the red man and unsuspecting settler. There
      have been instances where, after a long career of depredation, these
      offenders have aroused the vengeance of the back-woods settler, when his
      punishment became as sweeping as his hospitality had before been warm and
      unsuspecting. In general, however, the western <i>squatter</i> is a free
      and jovial character, inclined to mirth rather than evil, and when he
      encounters his fellow man at a barbecue, election, log-rolling, or frolic,
      he is more disposed to join in a feeling of hilarity on the occasion, than
      to participate in wrong or outrage. An encounter with the hostile red
      skins, or the wild animals of the forest is to him pleasurable excitement,
      and his fireside or camp-fire is rich with story of perilous adventure,
      and which seems only worthy of his remembrance, when fearfully hazardous
      in incident.
    </p>
    <p>
      Appended to these Western Sketches will be found several of a satirical
      and humorous character, which have met with some favor; though of a local
      character, they may contribute to the amusement of the reader, and if so,
      the object for which they were written has been attained.
    </p>
    <p>
      In conclusion, allow me to add, that the within pages are written as much
      for the reader's amusement as the illustration of odd incidents and
      character, and if they fail in this, they fail altogether;&mdash;it is
      certain I have tried to be funny, and not to succeed in such an effort is
      the most hopeless of all literary failures. I shall leave the decision of
      this, to me momentous, question, to the indulgence of the public, and hold
      myself ready to &ldquo;back out&rdquo; if they decree it, or attempt a better effort
      under their approving smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      A word to the critics:&mdash;Gentlemen, I have a high respect for you, and
      some little fear, and I, therefore, beg of you to touch me lightly&mdash;if
      you touch me at all; or, in the language of the Irish pupil, when about to
      receive a thrashing from his tutor;&mdash;&ldquo;If you can't be <i>aisy</i>, be
      as aisy as you <i>can!</i>&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. THE WAY HE WAS &ldquo;BROUGHT UP.&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">J</span> ohn Earl, the
      subject of our story, was a true and veritable specimen of the genus <i>Jour
      Printer</i>,&mdash;intelligent, reckless, witty, improvident, competent,
      and unsteady,&mdash;floating on the great sea of life, regardless of
      either its winds or tides,&mdash;but little troubled about the present,
      and perfectly indifferent as to the future. John was the son of a
      Philadelphia printer, who died soon after his marriage, and the grief and
      destitution of our hero's mother so preyed upon her slender frame, that in
      giving birth to him she sunk under her sufferings&mdash;the wail of her
      offspring in this world was the knell which signalled her departure to
      another. That &ldquo;the poor aids the poor,&rdquo; was a saying verified in John's
      case, for a poor shoemaker in the house adjoining his home took charge of
      the bereaved infant, and sheltered it beneath his humble roof. The worthy
      son of Crispin had none of his own to trouble him, and his wife and
      himself, as their little charge budded into prattling childhood, grew
      daily more fond of him, until our hero held at least his third of interest
      in the household. At his own request he was permitted to learn the same
      business his father had been bred to, and with many injunctions, and a
      good suit of clothes, he was consigned at a proper age to a master
      printer. Soon after his transfer to his new home, his adopted parents bade
      him farewell. The old shoemaker had become infected with the western fever
      for emigration, and after long and repeated consultations with his wife,
      had concluded to depart to the land of rapid fortunes and unbounded
      enterprise. The parting was affectionate, and after many fond wishes for
      each other's happiness, our hero was left to the mercies of the &ldquo;Art
      preservative.&rdquo; We need not say that he grew wise in its mysteries, we will
      assume it as a matter of course. John was, or rather grew to be of a happy
      disposition, and viewed life as something resembling Pat's pig, a compound
      of alternate streaks of fat and lean, and whenever fortune looked through
      her blue spectacles upon his progress, he always set it down as his streak
      of lean, and grew happy amid his distresses, under the firm belief that
      his alternate slice of fat was next in order. He was a philosopher in the
      true sense of the word, for he let no occurrence of life rumple the couch
      of his repose&mdash;if he didn't like his quarters he took up his store of
      earthly wealth upon the end of a stick, and travelled. At the period of
      which we write, John had tasted four or five years of the responsibility
      of manhood, and had, from the day of his freedom, been an occasional
      visiter to all the Atlantic cities; he had now grown tired of his old
      tramping ground, and turned his eye westward. Who knows, thought John, but
      I may find a Mount Arrarat in the new land whereon to rest my ark! &ldquo;The
      west, aye,&rdquo; thought John, &ldquo;that mighty corn field&mdash;that region of
      pork and plenty&mdash;land of the migrating sucker&mdash;haven of hope,
      and country of adventure, I stretch out my arms towards thee, take me up
      like a mother, and be kind to your new child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gathering up his shirt No. 2, and overcoat No. 1, into a handkerchief
      valise, and wending his way to a Baltimore steamer, he proceeded on board,
      deposited his bundle, and shook the dust of the city from his feet. From
      the deck of the steamer he looked out upon the mart of trade, covered with
      its busy hundreds, who were rushing to and fro, and running in and out of
      the great store-houses, like swarms of bees around their hives.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor fellows,&rdquo; soliloquized John, &ldquo;how soon old time will knock them
      over, and distribute all the honey they are toiling for among a new
      generation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A ringing of the steamer's bell disturbed his musings, and all became, for
      a few minutes, bustle and confusion&mdash;the engine moved, and the
      paddles answered its clank with a splash, a moment more and they were
      moving in the stream, and wending their way past the rows of shipping. As
      the smoke of the city faded from their view, John turned about to look
      upon his fellow passengers; some looked pleased, as if the trip was one of
      pleasure; others sad, as if departing from joys; whilst a portion,
      discontented with what they had left, appeared determined to dislike what
      they were journeying to, and muttered their displeasure audibly. Standing
      alone, leaning over the rail, was a fine looking elderly gentleman, whose
      countenance wore an air of quiet content and goodness&mdash;it was,
      indeed, one of those inviting countenances that we sometimes see possessed
      by honorable old age, which tells of wise thought and kindly sympathy,
      instead of a callous heart and suspicious mind, and our hero selected its
      owner for a travelling acquaintance. Approaching him, and leaning over a
      rail by his side, he remarked, &ldquo;We are moving through the water, sir, with
      lightning speed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This assertion being most palpable and manifest, the old gent remarked in
      turn that they were moving with rapidity. Having fully agreed upon this
      point, John ventured further to enquire, &ldquo;If it had ever occurred to his
      mind that steamboats were a great invention, any how?&rdquo; The old gentleman
      acknowledged &ldquo;he had been forcibly struck with the fact.&rdquo; Now, these
      passes of conversation may appear to the reader as very trivial and
      commonplace, but let us assure him they led to important results&mdash;they
      broke the ice which lay between two bodies, and let their souls float into
      contact. John having, as it were, got hold of the cover of
      non-intercourse, which most travellers wear, just unfolded it at each
      corner, and by his wit, intelligence, and reckless gaiety, folded himself
      up next the old man's heart, and tucked the corners of the robe under him.
      The old man soon became delighted with our hero, and they became
      inseparable <i>compagnons du voyage</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A small bell was rung, and immediately the clerk commenced taking up
      tickets. Here was an eventful period for John&mdash;he had not troubled
      himself with the necessary receipt for passage, for one very good reason&mdash;he
      had none of the needful to purchase it with; like all philosophers he had
      great faith in luck, and now resigned himself to her care.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take your ticket, sir,&rdquo; said the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you would,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;if you see it any where about me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clerk took a stare at our hero, and then remarked, &ldquo;I have no time to
      jest, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I any inclination,&rdquo; added John, &ldquo;the fact is, my friend, I've got no
      ticket, and as uncle Sam is my only existing relation, and as you have a
      contract with him, suppose you book me as one of his males.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say I have no time for jesting, sir,&rdquo; reiterated the clerk, in an angry
      tone, &ldquo;so please to hand me your ticket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; continued John, &ldquo;I'll have to let you into my secret, I see,&mdash;I'm
      an attaché of the press, on my road to Washington;&mdash;now, I suppose,
      its all right. You are aware if I am delayed, Gales and Seaton will be
      very angry, and Blair and Rives get in a pucker.&rdquo; The clerk was here
      getting into a wrathy state, when John's old friend reached the clerk the
      amount of his passage, and he passed on. John objected, but the old man
      insisted upon lending it to him, and the matter of fare being settled they
      sped onward smoothly as before. &ldquo;Here's a streak of fat&rdquo; thought John,
      &ldquo;for I have accidentally fell in with a travelling angel,&rdquo; and as some
      return for his generosity, he set about making himself particularly
      agreeable to his old companion. In the course of their conversation the
      old gent learned John's history, and that he was now on his way to
      Washington in search of business, to raise money enough to carry him west.
      His companion informed John that he was a western man, and invited him to
      bear him company to his home in Cleveland, Ohio; but our hero preferred
      the Mississippi country. He agreed, however, if he should fail in gaining
      business in Washington, to accompany him to Wheeling, provided he would
      increase the debt already incurred, and trust to the goddess, luck, for
      payment. After being assured that his company was considered worth double
      the sum, the matter was set at rest, and they entered Washington together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man had business in the city, and proposed to our hero, that while
      he was transacting it, he should take a stroll through the offices and see
      what chance there was for employment, and afterwards meet him at the
      Capitol. They separated, and when they again met, according to
      appointment, our typo &ldquo;reported no progress,&rdquo; so it was instantly agreed
      they should depart for Wheeling. As they gazed from the &ldquo;spectator's
      gallery,&rdquo; John whispered to his companion:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know the mass of those patriots below, and rightly appreciate them, for
      I have been behind the curtain&mdash;have helped some of them to make good
      English of their speeches to Bunkum,&mdash;have seen their tricks to get
      office, and their tricks to keep them,&mdash;have seen the way the cat
      jumps, and seen it jump too; in short, I'm up to the whole 'wool pulling'
      system, and I advise them to go it while they can, for the people may one
      day find them out, and then their spreading here will end in a sprawl at
      home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had gradually grown warm in his soliloquy, until his voice became
      audible, when the speaker struck his hammer, the sergeant-at-arms started
      for the gallery, and John and his old friend started for the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the next morning the two departed west, leaving the seat of government
      and its official inhabitants, for the broad land of promise which lay
      beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What think you of the capital?&rdquo; enquired the old gentleman, as they
      journeyed onward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The worst,&rdquo; answered our hero, and assuming a Timon of Athens attitude,
      he added, &ldquo;I have turned my back upon it in disgust. It is a theatre of
      the worst passions in our nature&mdash;chicanery lurks within the cabinet,
      distrust and envy without, while fawning sycophancy environs it around and
      about. To sum it up, it is a little of government&mdash;a great deal of
      'bunkum,' sprinkled with a high seasoning of political juggling, the whole
      of which has but one end and aim&mdash;the spoils of Uncle Sam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; exclaimed his old friend, &ldquo;you will have to get elected from some
      of the Western states, and set about cleaning the Augean stable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; answered John. &ldquo;It's too dirty a job, and besides, the sovereign
      people claim it as their peculiar privilege, let them smell it out for
      themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Discussing thus, things political, they jogged on to their place of
      parting, without incident worthy of noting by the way. John still held to
      his desire of visiting the Mississippi country, and his old friend
      insisted on paying his expenses to Cincinnati, our hero easily yielded to
      his proposition, with the understanding that it was to be paid when they
      again met.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may one day see you in Cleveland,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;with fortune buckled on
      my back, and if it should be there, 'whether I will or no,' be assured I
      shall not cut my old friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man laughed at the careless abandon of his young friend, insisted
      upon his calling upon him in Cleveland when he had become tired of
      strolling, and they parted with warm expressions of regard. Our hero
      having found a boat which drew so little water, that it would, as the
      captain said, &ldquo;run up a tree with a drop of the element upon it,&rdquo; he
      embarked on board, and stretching his form out in one of the state-room
      berths, gave liberty to his thoughts, and wandered back in memory to his
      childhood. Vainly did his memory search for some kindred face to dwell
      upon, the only semblance to such was the old shoemaker and his wife; and
      next to them he placed his late companion,&mdash;for he and his adopted
      parents were the only beings in his recollection who had ever bestowed
      upon him disinterested, kindly regard. He felt that he had floated like a
      moat in the sunbeam, whithersoever the breeze listed, having no home where
      he might nestle in health, or lie down in when seized by affliction&mdash;no
      port opened its arms to his bark, nor had it any destination&mdash;because
      it had no papers! but floated upon the broad wave of life the sport of
      fortune&mdash;and a hard fortune at that. As these thoughts stole over his
      heart, it became sad, and for the first time in years its fountains filled
      up to overflowing, and poured its burning waters over his cheeks. The
      future was a matter of such uncertainty, that he did not care to think
      upon it, nor at that moment did he care what it might bring forth&mdash;if
      good, well; if evil, it would be but a change from one feature of hard
      fortune to another. In due course of time the queen city of the west
      appeared in the distance, and his heart revived as he gazed upon her young
      greatness&mdash;hope awoke from her short slumber to urge him forward to
      greater efforts. On landing he sought out a printing establishment, and at
      his first application fortune favored him&mdash;a streak of fat was
      waiting for his arrival in the pork city, so throwing off his coat, he was
      soon clicking the type to the tune of &ldquo;better days&rdquo; and here we shall
      leave him until our next chapter.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. AN ADVENTURE AMONG THE OFFICIALS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>ur hero passed
      about two months in the queen city, when the desire to move again attacked
      him, and with the impulse he shaped his way for the Hoosier state, alone,
      and on foot. He was in that peculiar state of mind, and pocket, which
      calls forth all the coolness and wisdom of the philosopher, and to
      strengthen him on his journey he called up to mind all those illustrious
      examples of his craft, who had entered strange towns barefooted, and after
      rose to eminence and distinctions; several of whom now figured
      conspicuously upon the stage of public action. Trudging along thus, now
      stopping by the roadside to rest and muse, again plodding onward; now
      weary and desponding, again cheered by the carolling of the wood
      songsters, he would flourish his staff with sovereign contempt for care,
      whistle&mdash;&ldquo;While you are young, you should be gay,&rdquo; and fixing his hat
      tighter upon his brow step out again with a republican stride. Earth had
      on her gayest livery, and the rich foliage of the western forests
      fluttered in a gentle breeze; which also fanned the brow of the solitary
      wanderer, as he toiled up a rising hill in his pathway. On reaching the
      brow of this small eminence he looked down upon a flourishing town which
      lay in the valley below him, and his spirits rose as he gazed upon the
      national flag, invitingly fluttering from the top of a snug-looking hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huzza for the old striped bunting!&rdquo; shouted John, &ldquo;there is luck wherever
      it waves supreme, and if I don't come across a streak of fat soon, to
      recompense me for the long lean one I have been enjoying, then 'republics
      are ungrateful,' and I shall join the aristocracy and declaim against
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The village upon which John was gazing was at that particular period the
      scene of unusual commotion, anxious expectation, and great excitement&mdash;every
      inhabitant appeared on tiptoe about something. The porch of the hotel was
      occupied by a group of leading citizens of the town, among whom was the
      postmaster, the squire, the parson, a distinguished physician, a member of
      the bar, and sundry smaller dignitaries attached to the official stations
      of the county-seat. The blacksmith would every now and then quit his
      forge, step oat of his shop, and wiping the sweat from his brow take a
      long and searching look up the road, and then returning, pound away at the
      heated iron with powerful energy. The popular shoemaker was leaning out of
      his window looking earnestly in the same direction as his neighbor&mdash;the
      girls were peeping through their windows in a state of expectancy, and the
      young bucks of the town, dressed in their best, were flitting about in
      sight of the fair inhabitants, or clustering in groups directly opposite
      the abode of certain village beauties, while the more juvenile portion of
      the community were throwing up dust in the street, and huzzaing in a most
      animated and enthusiastic manner&mdash;in short, the town wras upon the
      eve of a great occasion. The member of congress, from that district, was
      expected to partake of a public dinner, on that day, at the principal
      hotel of the town of M., in the state of Indiana, and his constituents had
      prepared to give him a hearty reception on his return home, for the able
      manner in which he had defended their interests. He wras expected every
      moment, and of course, the place was big with anticipation.
    </p>
    <p>
      John wended his way unnoticed down the street, but observing everything&mdash;his
      keen eye discovered not only matter of interest in the commotion, but high
      promise&mdash;there was evidently something &ldquo;out,&rdquo; for the throbbing town,
      the fluttering banner, and the anxious groups betrayed it. Entering the
      hotel where the principal citizens were assembled, John mingled with the
      throng in the bar room, and listened to learn the cause of the gathering;
      how did his heart swell within him (for it had plenty of room) when he
      heard that a public dinner was on the tapis, a real bona fide dinner, of
      fish, flesh, and fowl, with an abundance of good liquor. John determined
      to search out the location of that town upon the map, and mark it down in
      his remembrance as possessing a highly civilized community. The landlord's
      son, an urchin of about six years of age, was every now and then running
      into the hall, and then out into the street, huzzaing at every termination
      of his race, running against every body, and putting on all sorts of wild
      antics&mdash;he appeared to have &ldquo;cut&rdquo; his comrades in the street, and was
      going the enthusiastic on his own hook, as if fully impressed with the
      honors descending upon his father's house&mdash;him our hero fixed upon to
      learn particulars, and seizing him as he entered the hall, enquired who
      was coming to eat the dinner that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey, why, don't you know?&mdash;I guess you're a fellar of the other
      party;&mdash;it's the Governor that's a comin',&rdquo; and off dashed the young
      publican.
    </p>
    <p>
      An alarm now drew the crowd in the bar room out to the porch, barkeeper
      and all, and a citizen having left his glass untasted upon the counter,
      while he went to see the matter of interest outside, John just took the
      liberty of tasting the contents, by way of a priming to nerve him for
      future contingencies, and, after, quietly strolled to the rear of the
      house, where discovering a darkey blacking boots, he stuck up his
      dust-covered extremities, and authoritatively ordered him to brush them
      up; the darkey obeyed, and a wash after, at the pump, brought out John's
      genius bright as a &ldquo;new dollar&rdquo;&mdash;to use his own expression, he was &ldquo;<i>a
      full case and printed copy!</i>&rdquo; While he was arranging his cravat in the
      sitting room, a shout rent the air which made the glass before him rattle.
      Again! again! huzza! and dashing down to the hotel came a barouche
      containing the guest, with the judge of the district, a member of
      legislature, and the county clerk. Huzza! shouted the village&mdash;huzza!
      shouted our hero,&mdash;bang! went a small swivel at the upper end of the
      town&mdash;white waved the ladies' handkerchiefs, and high swelled the
      heart of a nation's statesman. At that exciting moment the Indiana
      representative loomed upon the public eye almost majestic&mdash;Clay was
      no-where, Polk wasn't thought of, Webster was but a patching, and Van
      Buren was small potatoes&mdash;the only comparisons to the returned
      representative, were Washington and old Hickory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The signal was now given, and in poured the subscribers to the dinner,
      with their guest, and in poured John &ldquo;on his own hook.&rdquo; The dining room
      shook with applause as the member took his seat. The judge presided upon
      the occasion, and after a blessing by the parson, they set to at the
      viands. We need not enter into particulars as to how the eatables looked
      or how they were eaten, suffice it they were choice and plentiful, and
      that the company showed an appreciation of their worth by clearing the
      table! The host&mdash;on this occasion the happy host&mdash;stood behind
      the member's chair with a napkin, as if waiting for the great man to get
      through, so he might wipe his mouth and hands for him. The enthusiasm, and
      the liquor, had set the host's face in a glow; he looked as if he felt the
      greatness of the occasion, and he said he didn't care, if they devoured
      every thing in his house&mdash;he was repaid by the honor, indeed, he
      didn't know that he had anything more to live for after that day, it was
      the crowning period of his career. John, happy John! was actually
      devastating everything within his reach&mdash;he hadn't had such a chance
      for days, aye, weeks, and like Dugald Dalgetty, he not only made the most
      of the present, but carefully laid up a small provision for the future. He
      laughed at all jests within hearing, and scattered his own with unusual
      brilliancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The period had now arrived for the toasts and speeches, the feast of
      reason and the flow of liquor. After the regulars were drank, the county
      clerk gained the floor and offering a few striking and pertinent remarks,
      wherein he dwelt upon how the nation, and Indiana in particular, had been
      rescued by their representative, he proposed the following:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our representative, Charles Stumper, Esq., a pure patriot of Indiana, may
      a nation's gratitude yet make him a nation's head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amid the loud plaudits which followed, Charles Stumper, Esq., bowed his
      head as if that head was already a national crowning piece, and swallowing
      a spoonfull of cold water, he arose from his seat with a dignity befitting
      his august station. We have not room here to give his speech in detail&mdash;it
      was, of course, great&mdash;it couldn't be anything else! When he finished
      by saying that, &ldquo;hereafter, body, bones, blood and all were devoted to
      their service,&rdquo; a shout went up that shook the town of M. like a small
      earthquake. Before he took his seat he offered the following compliment:
      &ldquo;The town of M., while its citizens have an existence, the country is
      safe!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By a loud shout the citizens of M. proclaimed that they would save the
      country. During these enthusiastic proceedings our hero, by his urbanity,
      wit, sentiment, and good humor, had won a host of friends around him, and
      considerable curiosity was manifested to know who he was, but no one
      seemed able to give a satisfactory reply. Some said, he came with the
      congressman, and was his particular friend; others went so far as to
      intimate that he was another congressman in disguise&mdash;indeed, it was
      whispered that he was a senator incog!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on, fellars,&rdquo; said one of the citizens, &ldquo;jest hold your hosses, boys&mdash;he'll
      come out directly; ther's suthin' more in that fellar than's on the
      outside!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All appeared to agree to this sage opinion, and held their &ldquo;hosses&rdquo;
       accordingly. At length a pause occur-ing, as agreed upon by the editor of
      the county paper, the principal lawyer of the town toasted &ldquo;The Press, the
      guardian of republican liberty.&rdquo; This toast was offered to afford the
      county editor a chance to deliver a speech, which he had prepared for the
      occasion, but before he could clear his throat and get upon his legs, John
      had gained the floor, and in a clear tone called the attention of the
      table. Here was a subject upon which John was at home&mdash;he knew the
      press &ldquo;like a book,&rdquo; and with easy manner and consummate assurance, opened
      upon the great subject of its power. As he proceeded, all eyes dilated!&mdash;he
      pictured its progress from its earliest advent&mdash;its days of weakness,
      until its present wide-spread influence and power; he grew eloquent, and
      at length wound up with the following flourish:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the press, gentlemen, we owe all the astonishing achievements of
      modern times&mdash;they are the fruits of its power. It was the press
      which in an iron age unshackled the mind of man and gave free scope to his
      intellect,&mdash;taught him to soar over the elemental fields which gird
      him round about, and search into the sources of his own being, the causes
      which produced the great harmony in universal nature, and how to draw from
      those causes effects which would promote his happiness&mdash;sent him
      forth upon the great field of discovery, and spreading his achievements
      before the world, drew forth the might of mind to his aid, and now having
      led him to subdue the very lightning to his will, is by its aid scattering
      intelligence broadcast through the earth. It is not merely the guardian of
      Liberty&mdash;it is its creator! As the sun is to the solar system, so is
      the press to human society; eclipse either, and man is left in a night of
      darkness more dreadful than annihilation!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Applauses long and loud greeted his closing words; even the ladies,
      looking through the windows of the hotel from the porch which surrounded
      it, joined in the tokens of satisfaction, and now more eagerly than ever
      the question was propounded&mdash;&ldquo;who is he?&rdquo; No one knew, but all were
      high in his praise, and honors were showered so thick upon him that he
      hardly knew what he was about&mdash;every body wanted to drink with him,
      and he drank with every body. Order was called for his toast, and he gave&mdash;&ldquo;The
      ladies of M.&mdash;If heaven should blot out the stars, we will not
      discover the loss while surrounded by their bright eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The huzzas became so deafening, the glory was so unexpected, and the
      liquor was so pungent, that John lost his compass, and began to beat about
      wild. Some one said he would make a first rate stump speaker, and to prove
      his capability he commenced a political speech,&mdash;sad mishap!&mdash;sad,
      because he forgot which side he should be on! and commenced a most
      scathing tirade against the very party he was feasting with. He had so won
      upon their good opinion that they listened patiently for awhile, but
      patience soon melted away, and &ldquo;turn him out,&rdquo; was shouted from all sides
      of the table&mdash;the editor of the county paper was most violent for
      thrusting him out, for John had cut him out of his speech on the press.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turn him out!&rdquo; shouted the editor, &ldquo;he's a base <i>spy</i> in the camp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John perceived in a moment his fatal error, and felt happy that it did not
      occur until dinner was over&mdash;he felt that he had made an impression,
      and was proud that it was through no compromise of principle he had tasted
      of their hospitality, and showed them he was an opponent still; all that
      remained now, was to make a dignified retreat, and raising, with some
      difficulty, erect, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, when I entered, (hic)-tered this assembly, I thought I was
      among brethren, but I, (hic) I find I was deceived, and that I have been
      somewhat contaminated through error, so, (hie) so with your permission
      I'll withdraw and repent. I will no long-(hic) longer be one of you, but
      go forth to breathe a freer air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment he raised his hat to place it on his head, with a flourish,
      when out dropped the half of a chicken, and two doughnuts, which he had
      stowed away for a lunch. Their falling just at that particular moment
      bothered him, and to leave them there bothered him worse, but to pick them
      up was too humiliating&mdash;he scorned the action; since they would fall,
      why there let them lie, he would none of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old fellar,&rdquo; said a hoosier citizen, &ldquo;you'd better pick up your chicken
      fixens afore you go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; shouted John, indignantly, &ldquo;I should des-(hic) despise myself if
      I carried off the spoils of the enemy&mdash;you and your fragments may go
      to the d&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A yell followed his retreat, which would have shaken the nerves of a
      Coriolanus, but they steadied our hero's, and calm and composed he strode
      through the door leading from the dining room. The county editor seized
      the chicken and doughnuts, and hurled them after him, when John coolly
      closed the door, picked up the indignities, put them in his hat, and
      departed. Taking the road which led from the town, he turned his back upon
      the scene of the late festivities. As he again plodded onward he might be
      heard ejaculating&mdash;&ldquo;Well, wasn't that a streak of fat! What a dinner!
      Fit for the gods, as I'm a gentleman! Rather funny at the winding up, but
      the commencement and the continuation was conducted with statesmanlike
      skill, and after all, the winding up was but an agreeable little
      interlude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As John crept into a barn that night, some few miles from the town of M.,
      and stretched himself upon the straw to sleep off the glories of the day,
      he quietly murmured to himself&mdash;&ldquo;Well, here goes for another streak
      of lean!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER III. JOHN'S EDITORIAL CAREER.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>n our hero's
      peregrinations he wandered into the Sucker state, the country of vast
      projected rail roads, good corndodger, splendid banking houses, and poor
      currency, and during his progress therein he earned and hoarded about one
      hundred and fifty bona fide dollars. With this store of wealth jingling in
      his pockets, he entered the town of B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;; he did
      not come now as the needy adventurer, but as one holding one hundred and
      fifty considerations entitling him to respect. The world had taken a wider
      spread to his eye, and assumed new features, or rather he began to see
      with a clearer vision, for the common order of society appeared now, as
      plain as daylight, to have most villainous faces, and the respectability
      of wealth was as apparent as moonshine&mdash;he could now easily assign a
      reason for the deference paid to high station&mdash;in short, he had
      arrived at a state of feeling highly becoming the possessor of increasing
      wealth. Addressing the innkeeper of the town, who was a member of one of
      the first families, with an air of consequence, he demanded a whole room
      for his accommodation, when heretofore the third chance in a bed would
      have been considered a luxury, oriental in its character, and a blessing
      befitting a &ldquo;three tailed bashaw.&rdquo; The little town was an important one,
      as all sucker towns are, yet the arrival of our hero was enough to create
      a sensation from its one extremity to the other. An acquaintance with the
      innkeeper soon gained him an introduction to the member of the legislature
      from that district, and this opening soon made him intimate with the town.
      Many efforts were made by the citizens to &ldquo;draw him out,&rdquo; and learn his
      business, but John kept dark. &ldquo;He's a close fellar,&rdquo; said a sucker
      citizen, &ldquo;but I reckon, arter all, his business is pole-ticks.&rdquo; These and
      sundry other &ldquo;ambiguous givings out,&rdquo; assured our hero that he was a
      subject of general interest. &ldquo;What is his politics?&rdquo; was a question of
      import, duly discussed in the leading political circles; and &ldquo;was he
      married?&rdquo;&mdash;and, &ldquo;who'd get him, if he wasn't?&rdquo; was equally an
      absorbing matter of interest among the ladies; indeed, an animated
      discussion as to his preference had already caused a coolness between
      several pairs of devoted female friends. It was said that the pert Miss A&mdash;,
      the storekeeper's daughter, had absolutely walked down the principal
      street of B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, right before our hero, swinging the
      skirt of her frock in a most enticing manner. Such a bold and forced
      movement to take him by surprise, before any other maid could get a
      chance, was declared, at a tea and gossip party, to be most &ldquo;tolerable and
      not to be endured.&rdquo; At length his object was made known&mdash;he inquired
      of the legislative member, if that was a good point to establish a paper,
      and as soon as his surprise would permit, the member declared it to be an
      immense place, indeed, an enormous location, and more than that, the
      material for an establishment was in the town, had been in operation, and
      all it wanted was an editor to conduct the paper. John signified his
      ability and willingness, and the intelligence spread through the town like
      a prairie fire, and some pretty noses turned up as their owners exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;Why,
      I swow, he's only a printer, after all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The member for the district, along, lanky, cadaverous lawyer, who was
      death on a speech, powerful in chewing tobacco, and some at a whisky
      drinking, was part owner of the printing concern, and having an opponent
      in the district, who had started a paper in the lower town, on the river,
      to oppose him, he was most anxious to get the press going; so, assuring
      John he could have it at his own terms, and one hundred and fifty
      subscribers to commence with, which must of course swell to a thousand,
      they settled the matter, and proceeded to examine the establishment. It
      was at length agreed that our hero should give one hundred and twenty-five
      dollars of his one hundred and fifty, in cash, and his note for four
      hundred and fifty dollars more, payable at the end of a year, besides
      fifty dollars rent for the office, which also belonged to the lawyer. A
      meeting of the first citizens of the town was held on the ensuing evening,
      to which John Earl, Esq., was formally introduced as the new editor of the
      B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; Eagle, and the re-commencement of the paper
      duly discussed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've hearn tell of the bank and tariff questions?&rdquo; inquired a leading
      constituent and subscriber.
    </p>
    <p>
      John answered &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; he was somewhat acquainted with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, hoss, we 'spect you to be right co-chunk up to the hub on them thar
      questions, and to pour it inter the inimy in slasher gaff style.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John agreed to do his prettiest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the town below us,&rdquo; continued the constituent, &ldquo;thar is a fellar of
      the inimy who's dead bitter agin us and our town, so you must gin him
      scissors! Rile him up, and sot his liver workin', 'cause the skunk is
      injurin' our location. Advartis' our doins' in gineral, sich as we got to
      sell, and throw yourself wide on the literary fixins and poetry, for the
      galls&mdash;and, Mister Earl, ef you ony do this genteely, and with
      spirit, the whole town will take the paper! Don't forgit to gin the town
      below particular saltpetre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John gave them to understand that if his subscribers wished it, he would
      not only cut up the editor, but throw the lower town into a series of fits
      which would cause its utter dissolution. All being duly settled, our hero
      retired to his room to dream of future greatness. Already did he behold
      sheets filled with editorial tact and talent&mdash;already was his name
      inscribed upon the roll with illustrious editorial contemporaries&mdash;Ritchie,
      Pleasants, Blair, Gales, Chandler, Prentice and Neal, those great names of
      the tripod tribe already numbered him on their list, and he fancied &ldquo;his
      name grown great in mouths of wisest censure,&rdquo; while his pockets were
      correspondingly corpulent with the reward for such ability. Poor fellow,
      could he have drawn aside the curtain, and beheld the days of toil, the
      struggles to procure ink and paper, the labor of writing editorials, and
      the labor of setting them up, working them off at press, pasting up the
      mail, and the lack of reward which repaid this drudgery, he would have
      kicked ambition out of his company, and clutched his little hoard like a
      vice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The town of B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; and the town below, had been
      rivals ever since they were first laid out upon a map&mdash;the growth of
      one had always been the envy of the other, and an improvement in one was
      sure to be imitated by the other. The lower town had been most successful
      in the publication of a newspaper, for the reason that they paid something
      to support it, while the town of B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;- suffered for the
      neglect they manifested towards the press. The editor below not only
      abused the religion, politics, merchandise, and intelligence of B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      but the beauty of the women, and the smartness of the babies; he had even
      gone so far as to say that B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;- women and babies could
      be known by their heads. This was an outrage most unpardonable, and John
      rose in estimation as their defender against such vandal accusations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behold John seated scratching out his first editorial! Ah, ye weavers of
      cheap literature, who have watched with aching curiosity the appearance of
      your first production&mdash;ye writers of small poetry for daily journals,
      who have listened so eagerly for praise&mdash;ye penny editors who have
      successfully tickled the popular ear&mdash;ye ruling deities of mammoth
      weeklies, what are all your feelings, concentrated into one great throb,
      in comparison to the mighty throes of talent waking from her sleep in the
      mind of John Earl. It would have shocked the lower town like the heaving
      of a volcano, had they but known the shower of expletives our hero was
      tracing on the sheet before him. Goths and Vandals, corruption and
      spoilsmen, traitors and apostates, vile incendiaries and polluting vipers,
      poisonous demagogues, and a host more, bitter as sin, were showered like
      hail from his pen, when giving &ldquo;perticular goss&rdquo; to the lower town editor
      and his abettors.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the appearance of the first number our hero's consequence began to
      rise, the respectable citizens took him cordially by the hand, and their
      daughters smiled upon him, while the poorer inhabitants wondered at his
      &ldquo;larnin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A most excellent first number,&rdquo; said the lanky member, &ldquo;a good quantity
      of hot shot&mdash;just the thing&mdash;sew the lower town up&mdash;you've
      got prodigious talents&mdash;immense!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John bowed to the pleasing flattery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, hoss,&rdquo; said the storekeeper constituent and subscriber, &ldquo;You've
      slashed the hide off'er that fellar in the lower town, touched his raw,
      and rumpled his feathers&mdash;that's the way to give him jessy. I raily
      believe you'll git yourself inter the legislatur' afore long, ef you keep
      on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Our hero listened to these first breathings of fame with a swelling bosom&mdash;there
      was a chance of his becoming somebody, at last, and labor became a
      pleasure when it produced such a yield. At a public meeting called in the
      town he was elected secretary, and ventured on the occasion to make a
      speech, which was loudly applauded, and in the next number of the Eagle
      appeared a glowing description of the proceedings, with a synopsis of his
      own speech. This awoke some jealousy in the mind of the lanky member, who
      thought John wished to supplant him. As time progressed the Eagle
      increased its subscription to two hundred, its editor grew popular, in
      debt, and received nothing from his subscribers&mdash;indeed, he soon
      discovered that pay made up no part of their patronage, and he began to
      grow tired of laboring for glory alone. All this time the war was waging
      hotter and thicker between the towns and their editors. At length he of
      the lower town inserted in his &ldquo;Patriotic Herald and Telegraph&rdquo; the
      following:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are informed, from good authority, that the Buzzard of the Eagle
      cannot pay his board bill, and fears are entertained that he will slope
      without liquidating the debt!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was personal&mdash;every body said it was personal&mdash;the lanky
      member said it must be wiped out with blood&mdash;the storekeeper swore
      that John must &ldquo;eat the other fellar's gizzard,&rdquo; and the ladies of B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      resolved, at a tea party, that the death of the lower town editor could
      alone atone for the many indignities he had heaped upon them, and John was
      the very man to offer himself up as a sacrifice. All the subscribers to
      the Eagle were interested in the matter, for they would gain in any event,
      as how: If the lower town editor was removed, an enemy had perished; if
      John fell, a creditor's accounts were closed, so they were unanimous for a
      duel. The lanky member informed John of the general opinion of the public
      as to what he should do, and urged the sending of a challenge forthwith,
      which he offered to bear. John intimated that he must have a day to
      practise before he sent the missive, and this was acceded to as prudent,
      but bowie knives were recommended by his friend as much the safest and
      sure means of killing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our hero seated himself in the Eagle office that night, where the ghost of
      his departed greatness visited his waking thoughts, to laugh at his
      present misery. Of his one hundred and fifty dollars, but twenty-five
      remained&mdash;his clothes were nearly worn out&mdash;his board bill
      unpaid&mdash;his subscriptions and advertisements ditto, and the supply of
      paper and ink was insufficient for another issue, besides a duel on hand
      with another poor devil of an editor, and the whole town thirsting for the
      bloody transaction. A thought flashed upon his brain&mdash;he would go see
      his antagonist. No sooner was the idea conceived than he put it in
      execution. Gathering up his remaining twenty-five dollars he set off in
      the night for the lower town, where he arrived about daylight. After a
      hasty breakfast at the inn, he entered the &ldquo;Herald office,&rdquo; and seating
      himself upon the only chair in the establishment, inquired for the editor.
      A little pale man, engaged at case, lay down his composing stick and
      advanced, expecting a new subscriber, but started to run as soon as he was
      informed that the editor of the &ldquo;Eagle&rdquo; was before him. John stopped his
      egress and made him sit down while he talked to him. A conversation
      brought on mutual apologies, and he found his antagonist as great a
      sufferer as himself&mdash;the mere hack of county politicians, who had
      been lured by the same phantom&mdash;greatness, until he had worn himself
      to a corresponding shadow, chasing the vision. The two typo editors shook
      hands in friendship, and our hero departed homeward.
    </p>
    <p>
      On John's arrival he encountered the member, who urged the immediate
      despatch of the challenge, which John refused, and to his refusal added
      some words of contempt for the citizens of B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      and their representative in particular. This aroused the member, who
      declared that cowardice had driven him over to the enemy. To prove the
      falsehood of this assertion, John knocked the member down, and kicked his
      honor must indignantly. The editor of the Eagle was well aware, that after
      this outbreak he must &ldquo;break for tall timber,&rdquo; so cooking a smash dish of
      <i>pi</i> in his office, he bequeathed the feast to his successor, and
      leaving his subscription list, and interest in the concern, to pay his
      debts, he beat a hasty retreat. As he hurried through the woods skirting
      the river, the welcome puff of a steamer saluted his ear, and waving his
      handkerchief as a signal, she stopped, landed a boat, and took him on
      board.
    </p>
    <p>
      Farewell to B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, its dreams of greatness had
      faded to mist, and instead of growing honor, emolument, and renown, it had
      yielded naught but the fruit of bitterness, accompanied with toil and
      care, the end of which was a roll back to the bottom of the hill he had
      fancied already climbed. The great of earth will smile at his troubles,
      &mdash;happy for him that his disposition would only permit them to cause
      a momentary sadness. As the steamer receded from the scene of his late
      vexation and care, he began to rejoice in his freedom, and in a
      light-hearted mood, paced her deck, an untrammelled candidate for new
      fortune. Bright dreams of the future came again, and what a blessing it is
      that the lonely adventurer in this world is permitted to dream, for with a
      vivid imagination he may revel in joys which waking reality can never
      equal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us return a moment to B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. All there, as may
      be supposed, was a scene of confusion, indignation, and horror, at the
      outrage inflicted upon the member&mdash;he had absolutely been <i>kicked!</i>
      A warrant was issued for John, and then it was discovered he had sloped&mdash;more
      indignation! The editor of the lower town still lived, and the member had
      been kicked&mdash;horror! The office of the Eagle was in pi and its editor
      non est, which means nowhere&mdash;terrible excitement! Here was capital
      for the lower town editor, and didn't he use it&mdash;to use a classical
      expression he lit upon the upper town and its member &ldquo;like a thousand of
      brick!&rdquo; He charged them with starving their editor, charged their editor
      with cowardice, charged the member with tamely submitting to be kicked by
      the aforesaid cowardly editor, and wound up by asserting that the town of
      B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; produced nothing but pusillanimous men, ugly
      women, and pugnosed babies! The glory of B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      departed while the lower town swelled into vast importance, and its editor
      received a present of two new shirts from the ladies of his section,
      besides three spirited subscribers paid him one dollar each, of their four
      years subscription&mdash;a stretch of liberality so astounding, that to
      this day the event forms one of the most interesting legends of the Sucker
      state.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. HIS WANDERINGS THROUGH THE PRAIRIES.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">J</span> ohn, now released
      from his thraldom, bent his way to Chicago, to pursue fortune in the lake
      country, and landing at Peoria, he resolved to foot it across the
      prairies, to the head of Lake Michigan. His store, as usual, embraced a
      scanty wardrobe, attached to the end of a stick, and twenty dollars in
      cash. As he journeyed on, he would occasionally break into a laugh as the
      recollections of B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; would intrude themselves
      upon his thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      His former castle-building, however, served to enliven the way with
      merriment, as foot and eye travelled into the future, and setting the past
      down as so much paid for experience, he consoled himself with the thought
      of his youth and health, snapped his fingers at care, and held himself in
      an easy state of mind to receive whatever fate might send him. At the
      close of the second day of his journey he halted on the edge of a prairie
      at a small log house. A tidy woman was bustling about in the interior, and
      two children, whose little faces were yellow as saffron, sat listlessly
      upon the door sill, playing with bits of broken delf. Their narrow
      habitation presented little of comfort to cheer the inmates or welcome the
      traveller. He inquired if he could lodge there, and the woman answered
      that such as she had to offer, he was welcome to, but being a lonely
      widow, and far from where any thing comfortable could be obtained, she had
      but poor accommodations to offer. Our hero was easily pleased, and so
      signified to her. Depositing his bundle within, he took the axe from her
      hands, with which she was about to chop some wood, and throwing off his
      coat, he prepared the fuel to cook their evening repast, then seating
      himself upon a hickory bottomed chair, he took the widow's sickly little
      daughter upon his knee, and coaxed a smile into her wan countenance. The
      mother watched the gambols of her child with the merry stranger, and a
      tear of pleasure sparkled in her eye, while the feeling sent a pleasing
      expression over her sad countenance; she spoke to him, too, in a tone of
      kindness different from her first words, because there was something
      friendly about his manner, and his lighthearted gayety was cheering to her
      sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the table was spread, the corn cakes and pork placed upon it, with
      some milk, John seated himself with the children beside him, and attended
      to their little wants, with such kindness of manner, that ere the meal had
      ended, the little family began to imbibe something of their guest's gay
      spirit. As they gathered around the fire that evening, the widow ventured
      to inquire where her visiter was from, and when he informed her he was a
      Philadelphian, her eyes filled with tears,&mdash;that, too, was her
      birthplace. Looking upon the stranger, now, as a brother whom she had
      encountered in the wilderness, she poured into his ear her sad story. Her
      husband and herself, both young, had started some years previous from
      Philadelphia, for the west&mdash;his object being to secure a home of his
      own, and liking the spot W'here their cabin stood, they squatted, all went
      cheerfully for a time, but sickness soon came, and the prevailing fever of
      the country had swept him away from her side, leaving her far from the
      home of her childhood, with two children, friendless and alone. Sad days
      had passed since then, and hope was almost dead within her. Beneath a
      small hillock, surrounded with a little paling of pointed sticks, drove
      into the ground by her own hands, reposed the remains of her husband, and
      there lay buried all her hopes for the future. John spoke cheeringly to
      her, and to divert her thoughts from present sorrow, talked of their
      far-off home. The widow's little girl nestled in his lap, her little hands
      clasped around one of his, her head reclining upon his breast, while on a
      stool at the mother's side sat her little boy, and thus and there the
      wandering printer called up a panorama of their birthplace. Old Christ
      Church bells sounded in their ears again a Christmas' peal&mdash;together
      they wandered by the Schuylkill side; or, climbing. Fair Mount hill,
      looked out upon the wide-spread city; or, trod again its streets teeming
      with a gay and busy populace&mdash;each well-known antique habitation or
      hall, remembered by both, was spoken of with affection, as a memento of
      happy days&mdash;the wide and dreary prairie, over which the autumn wind
      was sighing cold and sadly, was forgotten now&mdash;scenes far away rose
      like shadows around the inhabitants of the log mansion, and the hum of the
      old city drowned the voice of the west wind, as it moaned around their
      dwelling. There wras the place, and those the circumstances, in which home
      wore its most heavenly hue. The lone widow that night thanked Heaven in
      her prayers, that one had been directed across her pathway to cheer her
      heart with sweet remembrances; and in her dreams, as she wandered again
      among the scenes of childhood, the faces she met all bore resemblance to
      the stranger&mdash;their tones of welcome sounded like his, and a smile,
      sweet as ever, rested upon a virtuous mother's lip; she slumbered through
      the live long night in happiness. The good angel, who registers kindness
      of mortal to mortal, surely marked here a credit in favor of the typo.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the morning sun cast his golden sheen over the rich carpet of the
      prairie, John prepared to depart, and shaking the widow by the hand, he
      assured her that she should see home again, for he would search out her
      friends and have her sent for. As he stepped off from the house, the
      little girl run after him for a farewell kiss, and taking out of his
      pocket the remainder of his little wealth, seventeen dollars in all, he
      reserved one dollar for his travelling expenses, and placing his purse,
      with the remaining sixteen dollars, in the belt of the child, sent her
      back to her mother, and with the step of an emperor strode on his way. At
      the brow of a rising slope, in view of the cabin, he turned back to look,
      and saw the widow and her little ones watching his receding footsteps&mdash;raising
      his hat and kissing his hand he turned down the slope and was soon hidden
      from their sight. Improvident John, to thus give all thy store, except a
      trifle, to the widow and the orphan. Ah, ye cold and sordid ones of earth,
      a single thrill such as played about his heart then, was worth a mountain
      of your money bags. Contrasting his situation with the poor widow whom he
      had just departed from, he felt rich as Croesus&mdash;the craft of his
      hand, his robust youth, and a single dollar were odds in his favor against
      the worst circumstances.

    <p>
      Two days more had passed when weary and foot-sore he approached a small
      village, and accosting an inhabitant leaning over a fence, he inquired if
      there was any chance of employment in the neighborhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm of the opinion, stranger,&rdquo; said the sucker, &ldquo;that your chance
      here, is pretty much as to what you can do&mdash;ef you'r anythin' of a
      brick maker, Old Jo Simms wants a man at his yard, down thar at the
      branch; but you don't look amazin' like a mud moulder, hoss!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not much for looks,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;but I'm creation at shaping things,
      and as for bricks, I'm a whole load of them&mdash;'front stretchers,' at
      that&mdash;made of choice clay&mdash;Father Adam's patent&mdash;so just
      point the way to Jo Simms, and some day come over and see a specimen of my
      brick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Receiving the proper direction, down he went to the brick-maker's
      dwelling, where, on entering, he encountered old Mrs. Jo Simms, and a look
      at her good humored countenance satisfied him, that an instalment on his
      new situation, in the shape of a supper and bed, was not only possible,
      but very probable. After making known his business, the old lady surveyed
      his person, and remarked&mdash;&ldquo;Well, the old man did talk of hirin' some
      help, 'cause thar's a lot of brick orders on hand, and I suppose you
      mought do&mdash;you look dreadful draggled though, and tired as a prairie
      team, arter a hard day's ploughin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John readily assented to her comment on his appearance, and asked if he
      could'nt have something to eat and a bed, for he was both tired and
      hungry, after his tramp to see about the situation. The good matron,
      sympathisingly, prepared him a good supper, and conducted him to a small,
      neat room over the kitchen, where a clean bed and comfortable covering lay
      temptingly in repose, as if waiting for some weary body, to rest it. This
      was no time to philosophise on luck, so John turned in and straight
      addressed himself to sleep&mdash;it came without coaxing, and as Morpheus
      wrapped him in her poppy robe, it seemed to him a covering of the softest
      fur and brightest hues. His dreams were peopled by a weary train of foot
      passengers, who toiled along beneath a burning sun, with sticks across
      their shoulders, and bundles dangling at their ends, while he seemed drawn
      on a chariot of air, whose delightful floating motion lulled the senses
      into a soft, dreamy languor&mdash;not a sleep of forgetfulness, but one
      where the brain was sensible of the body's enjoyment&mdash;and refreshing
      breezes, laden with the fragrance of prairie flowers, fanned his brow. It
      was mortality tasting the repose of the gods! When morning broke John
      turned himself on his couch just to realise the truth of his situation,
      and hugged the covering to his rested body with a lover's fervor. As he
      thus lay enjoying the waking reality, a conversation in the kitchen below
      him attracted his attention. The old lady was telling her son, a young
      man, that an applicant for the situation of help in the yard, was sleeping
      above.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, have you engaged him?&rdquo; inquired the son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not azactly engaged him, but I gin the poor creatur' suthin' to eat,
      and sent him to bed, expectin' to be engaged in the mornin'&mdash;he's not
      jest strong enough, but appears mity willin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm consarned sorry you did any sich a thing,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;'cause we
      won't want a man for a month yit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the creatur' will be dreadfully disappinted,&rdquo; answered the old
      lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so much as you think, Mrs. Jo Simms,&rdquo; thought our hero, and then he
      began to congratulate himself on his good fortune:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a most lucky disciple of Faust,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I've had a supper fit for
      a lord, and a couch where the imperial form of sovereignty might repose
      unruffled&mdash;and did&mdash;for I'm an august representative of American
      sovereignty! What next? If the good angel of the lonely widow and her
      little ones don't now desert me, I stand 'a right smart chance' of getting
      a breakfast into the bargain!&mdash;Well,&rdquo; concluded John, &ldquo;this is too
      much luck for weak human nature to bear easily, so it is necessary to
      nerve myself, or I shall be overcome.&rdquo; Dressing himself, he descended to
      the kitchen, and made the acquaintance of the younger Jo Simms, who
      appeared very backward in breaking to our hero the sad news of his
      rejection as help in the yard. At length, however, he kindly broke the
      intelligence, and before John could answer he offered him two dollars to
      pay his expenses back, and, moreover, invited him to partake of the
      smoking repast just preparing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say no more about it, my dear sir,&rdquo; says John, &ldquo;such liberality removes
      the pain of disappointment.&rdquo; It was refreshing to see how his phiz lighted
      up at his luck, and all parties being perfectly satisfied, they enjoyed
      the morning meal with a relish. As John was about to depart, the good old
      dame rolled him up a lunch of short cake, and he bid farewell to brick
      making.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a short time he arrived at Chicago, where he obtained work at his
      business, but the exposure he had undergone brought on the fever and ague,
      which shook him out of all respect for Illinois, and he therefore
      determined to leave it, so embarking one bright morning, he shook it an
      adieu which made his teeth chatter, which excitement was of course
      followed by a most subduing fever.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the fifth day after their departure from Chicago, while crossing the
      head of Lake Erie, from Detroit river towards Cleveland, John had
      stretched himself after a shake, upon a settee at the head of the cabin,
      and in sight of the gangway leading to the boiler deck, and while thus in
      a reposing attitude he was enjoying quietly his fever, he observed one of
      the hands ascend from below, his visage all begrimed and covered with a
      profuse perspiration, and cautiously approach the captain, to whom he
      whispered something which produced much excitement in the commander's
      countenance, but his manner exhibited no haste. Coolly walking through the
      cabin and around the boat, he approached the gangway and looked below,
      then carefully surveyed the passengers, as if to note whether he waas
      observed. John, who had been watching his movements, arose from his couch
      and advanced towards him, the captain spread himself before the hold to
      prevent his seeing below, whereupon our hero, who had shrewdly guessed the
      cause of his agitation, whispered in his ear to descend, that he knew the
      steamer was on fire below, and while endeavouring to quench it, he would
      divert the attention of any who might approach the hold. The captain
      thanked him, and John took his post. How dreadful was their situation, yet
      how unconcerned all on board walked about, or lounged upon seats around
      the cabin and decks. Beneath them struggled one destroying element, and
      around them on either side, dancing in the sunbeams, spread another; while
      like a thread upon the surface of the far-off waters appeared the only
      land in view. Oh, how the flickering flame struggled in that dark hold for
      mastery, and how bravely the sinewy arms of its late masters battled to
      get it again in bondage. At one moment the hissing water appeared to have
      quenched it, but the next the bright flame curled up far in by the boiler
      side, and a fold of dark smoke would roll out derisively in the face of
      its foes. It was a contest for life, and here upon the broad wave the fire
      had them at fearful odds. In a short time the commander appeared on deck,
      very much agitated, and taking our hero aside, he declared to him that
      there was no hope&mdash;the fire was increasing! Calling the passengers
      together, he informed them of their situation, and opening a closet
      distributed among them a number of life preservers, then ordering the
      boats cleared, he coolly prepared for the catastrophe. Some of the
      passengers grew almost frantic; and if not prevented, would have plunged
      overboard to certain death; others calmly prepared for the worst, and some
      were amusing in their lamentations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captin, you'll hev tu pay right smartly for that truck of mine, if you
      git it spiled,&rdquo; said a down easter, &ldquo;and it's jest my luck tu meet with
      sech consarned ruin.&mdash;There ain't no sea sarpints in this lake as you
      know on, is there? du tell us, now, afore a fellow's shoved off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it sarpents?&rdquo; inquired an Irishman, &ldquo;oh, me darlint, if that was all
      we had to contind wuth, I'd curl him up like the worm uv a still, wid the
      crass I've got, but it's the thunderin' sharks that'll make short work uv
      a body, and divil a crass'll pravint thim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, these things,&rdquo; said Jonathan, holding up a gum elastic, &ldquo;they calls
      life presarvers; why, I swow tu gracious, if they aint more like patent
      forks, tu hold a fellar up, while the consarned lake varmints nibbles his
      legs off, comfortably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A large fat lady, who had provided herself with an enormous sized
      preserver, was in a dreadful way to know if her chance for floating was at
      all probable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, bless you, Marm,&rdquo; said the mate, &ldquo;there's wind enough about you to
      float a whaler.&rdquo;&mdash;The fat lady became tranquil with this assurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now proposed by the captain, to cut a hole through the vessel's
      deck, and pour in water directly upon the fire; this being the only hope
      for saving the vessel, it was instantly adopted, and willing hands in a
      few moments made the opening, into which the boat's hose was turned, and
      in a brief period, the engineer reported the heat abating. The spirits of
      all on board revived on hearing this intelligence, and a further
      application of the counter element removed all grounds for fear. As the
      horrors of their late situation disappeared, the light house at the mouth
      of Cleveland harbor rose in view, calming the fears of all, and marking in
      its welcome proportions the scene of rest for our wandering hero. What
      here chanced to befall him we shall reserve for our concluding chapter.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. HIS ENCOUNTER WITH OLD FRIENDS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span> ur hero, on
      landing in Cleveland, placed his bundle in one hand, and stick in the
      other, and thus leisurely sauntered up the hill and through the main
      street of this young mart of trade. Although his body drooped with
      sickness, the air of life and thriving industry which surrounded him,
      aroused his active mind to exertion. His old companion of travel resided
      here, and now was a fitting time to try his professions of regard. While
      reading the signs along the street, he mentally ventured the opinion that
      &ldquo;Smith &amp; Co.&rdquo; were doing an extensive business, for their name was
      attached to commercial concerns all over the country; and as thus
      ruminating, another, and quite as familiar a name, met his eye, besides it
      was a vastly more interesting name&mdash;none other than his old adopted
      Father's cognomen. He could scarcely bring himself to believe that the
      imposing store before him was really occupied by those who were so
      endeared to him by past kindness&mdash;that was a streak of too good luck
      to be possible; nevertheless, thinking he might gratify himself with a
      peep at the possessor of so honored a name, he approached the window, and
      looked into the interior&mdash;can it be?&mdash;yes it is!&mdash;&ldquo;plain as
      a pipe stem&rdquo;&mdash;sure enough, his old adopted father stood before him!
      There, amid the piles of soles and uppers, with spectacles on nose, and
      head a little bald, stood that veritable good old soul, who had sheltered
      his infant years. Time had not furrowed his brow with the chisel, but his
      brush had traced its easy progress; nor had the storm torn away his locks&mdash;the
      gentle zephyr had plucked the silvery threads away to sport with them in
      the sunbeam. Contentment lingered in his quiet smile, and &ldquo;well to do in
      the world,&rdquo; was legibly written upon his portly person. John entered the
      store, and putting on the air of a purchaser, seated himself upon a
      settee, and held his foot up to be measured&mdash;the old man adjusted his
      spectacles, kneeled down upon one knee, stole a glance over his glasses at
      his customer, and commenced taking the dimensions of our hero's foot; but
      there was an indescribable something about the face, which drove the foot
      from his memory, and while he was trying to rake up from the past some
      known body on which to fix the head and face, he forgot that he was
      holding the foot, until John asked him, if &ldquo;there w'as anything uncommon
      about its shape?&rdquo; The old man, stammering an excuse, started to his
      drawers to select a pair of the right size, but the stranger's face again
      so mixed itself up with the figures on his strap and rule, that he w'as
      forced to return and measure the foot over again. John observed his
      quandary, and smiled at the old man's efforts to recollect him. At this
      moment the old lady came to the door separating the shop from the
      dwelling, and looking in, spoke to her husband; our hero recognised her in
      a moment, he could not refrain himself, but springing to his feet with a
      shout, he laughingly held out his arms, exclaiming &ldquo;Mother, don't you know
      me!&rdquo; If not at the first glance, the tones of his voice, and the ring of
      his merry laughter, called up the vivid remembrance of his boyish days
      with the rapidity of thought, and throwing herself into his arms she
      sobbed with joy, as if he were in verity her own long lost offspring; the
      old man, too, dropping his measure, seized our hero; and here tears of
      true feeling mingled in one current&mdash;remembrances of the past
      clustered around, and joy, deep and holy as dwells within the human
      breast, held uninterrupted revel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The store was closed early that night, and as they were seated round the
      evening meal, John would, with sketches of his past history since they
      parted, at one moment draw from them shouts of merriment, and then again,
      as he dwelt on some hard streak of fortune, &ldquo;beguile them of their tears.&rdquo;
       Oh, it was a happy night, that night of meeting on the shore of the broad
      lake. The gay revel within sumptuous halls affords no joy like this, for
      here the fountains of the heart danced to the music of affection; the air
      to which they kept time was &ldquo;past days,&rdquo; and their pure current swelled
      into a flood of nature's kindliest harmony&mdash;all was joy, all
      happiness. With a motherly care, as in days of his childhood, the old lady
      stripped his neck, and washed away the dust of travel, then conducting him
      to a neatly furnished chamber, she kissed him good night, and retired to
      thank Heaven that her aged eyes had been permitted to see him again. While
      our hero slept happily above, the old folks talked long and earnestly in
      the chamber beneath him, and before they closed their eyes in sleep,
      resolved that he should never again part from them. They had none in this
      world to care for, save him, and Heaven, the old lady said, had sent him
      back to their roof to be an honor and comfort to their old age. In the
      morning they awoke to a renewal of these happy feelings, and over the
      breakfast table future plans were freely discussed. John mentioned his
      travelling acquaintance, and taking the card from his vest pocket, showed
      it to his adopted father, who immediately recognised the owner as one of
      his customers, one of the most wealthy, and of course, respected citizens
      in Cleveland. To visit him a new suit was necessary, and after the morning
      meal the old man piloted him to a tailoring establishment, and fitted him
      from head to foot in a fine suit&mdash;in short, he disguised our hero,
      and it was pleasant to see with what admiration the aged couple looked
      through their spectacles at the change.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I declare if you don't look like a gentleman, when you're dressed,&rdquo; said
      the old lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why not, mother?&rdquo; inquired John. &ldquo;It is the material which passes
      current for gentility. If half mankind, who now move through good society
      unquestioned, were placed in my old dusty suit, the world would never
      discover their claims to the title&mdash;no, no! After all, your fine suit
      is the world's standard of a fine gentleman&mdash;it will gain the owner
      consideration among mixed assemblies&mdash;credit in the mart of trade&mdash;a
      high place in the synagogue, and moreover, it is a general ticket,
      entitling its possessor to the world's civility!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, bless me!&rdquo; exclaimed the old woman, &ldquo;if they don't make a change in
      your talk&mdash;you're gittin' right toploftical.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After many thanks on our hero's part, and much admiration on the part of
      his friends, he received permission to wander forth and see his old friend
      of the road, to whose dwelling he was correctly directed by the shoe
      dealer. A kiss from his adopted mother, a five dollar bill from the old
      man, for pocket money, and out sallied John, his person erect, and step
      buoyant with good fortune&mdash;sickness had almost fled before his
      revived hopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The aged pair stood in the store door gazing on his manly form, as he
      receded from them, and a feeling of pride glowed in their hearts, the
      nearest akin to a parent's, that nature will permit. They knew that no one
      could rightfully dispute their claim to him, and proud in their
      pre-emption right, they retired into their dwelling with newly awakened
      pleasure. Arrived at his travelling acquaintance's mansion, he looked at
      the name of &ldquo;Charles C. Briggs, Attorney at Law,&rdquo; upon the door plate, and
      a glance at the exterior of the building, assured him that the dweller
      therein was one of the prosperous class of his profession. Knocking at the
      office door in the basement, he was bid enter, and on doing so found
      seated at a desk, surrounded with piles of legal lore, the same old
      gentleman who had so kindly bid him farewell at Wheeling. The recognition
      was mutual, and the old mail's manner truly cordial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, you found me out,&rdquo; said the attorney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied John, &ldquo;but a precious long tramp I've had to reach you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His friend insisted upon his seating himself, and relating an outline of
      his adventures, at which he laughed most heartily, and when John had
      finished, he clapped him on the back, saying&mdash;&ldquo;You are a lucky dog&mdash;in
      your first journey you have gathered more lessons of wisdom, than many
      meet with in a life time, and your mind may turn them into vast profit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'd like to realise something out of them,&rdquo; quietly remarked our
      hero, &ldquo;for I have expended all my capital in learning them.&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so, you have found other friends besides myself in Cleveland,&rdquo;
       remarked the lawyer, &ldquo;a worthy couple whom I happen to be acquainted with,
      also; between us, I think we will persuade you to become a fixture of
      society. I know not why, but I like you, and have often wished for the
      present meeting. Having no son of my own to assist me in my old days, and
      continue my business after me, I have felt a desire to find one who would
      fill the vacancy; your intelligence and happy disposition, on our trip,
      made me like you, and now I would fain ripen those feelings into a strong
      bond of friendship. Come, you must dine with me, and then we will talk of
      the future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John's heart was swelling with friendship already, and he could almost
      have hugged the kind old lawyer, but as this was his first day at his
      adopted parents, he was forced to excuse himself for the present, on
      promise of returning on the morrow, and with kindling aspirations and
      noble resolves, he returned to his parents. There he recounted the
      lawyer's words, and made known his intention of studying law with him,
      which met with general approval, and the little household put on quite an
      air of importance about its acquisition, while its mistress hurried about,
      chatting with her new found child with all the garrulousness of kindly old
      age.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the next day, John, according to appointment, placed his legs under the
      mahogany of his friend, the lawyer, and while the meal progressed he
      amused the company by relating some episodes of his travel and
      observation, but every now and then, a strange quietness might be observed
      to pass over his demeanor, and his eyes would wander furtively to the
      other end of the table, where was seated the fair daughter of his host,
      whose dark eyes met his stolen glances, and sent the blood tingling to his
      brows. Look another way, John,&mdash;there's danger in those dark eyes!
      What, you, who have looked unmoved at scores of bright eyes, to tremble
      now at a single pair&mdash;out upon you&mdash;look straight into those
      dark orbs, and dare their power&mdash;now!&mdash;pshaw, man, you shake and
      stammer as if a battery of loaded cannon, with the lighted fusees behind
      them, were pointed at you. Ah, I see, your merriment is at an end now&mdash;busy
      thoughts, strange dreams, and bright hopes are coursing through your
      bewildered brain. And so they were&mdash;that visit had planted new
      feelings in his breast. He entered the old lawyer's mansion, as he
      thought, the possessor of all he wished on earth&mdash;a home, and an
      opportunity to rise&mdash;yet here was aroused a feeling which absorbed
      all the rest&mdash;he never felt himself poor before. Before, he was the
      possessor of a light heart, but now that heart had been spirited away by a
      felonious pair of eyes, and his mind was racked with dread, for fear he
      might not be able to compromise with the possessor, and be permitted to
      keep it company&mdash;here was a &ldquo;take&rdquo; in the book of human nature, which
      was most &ldquo;fair copy,&rdquo; and fain would our hero take unto himself the page.
      Fear not, John, all in good time&mdash;the fair daughter of your old
      friend is troubled, too&mdash;a merry printer has, by his gentle manners,
      and most winning address, made a deep impression there, and is sadly
      troubling the little heart of its fair possessor. She thinks, she would
      like to forget him, but in trying to do so she must think of what she
      would forget, and thus he ever comes uppermost in her mind, and his
      pleasing countenance and coaxing eye gains a firmer footing in her
      affections.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrangements were made before the lawyer and out hero parted, that he
      should forthwith commence the study of law, and accordingly he set himself
      down upon Coke and Littleton, with the determination of becoming a pillar
      of the state. A most dangerous neighborhood he chose to study in&mdash;dangerous
      for the hasty progress of his studies in legal lore, for long before he
      was fitted for a single degree, as a student at the bar, he had become a
      professor of love; and how soon he learned to look deep into those eyes,
      and read the mind within, twine himself around the tendrils of the fair
      girl's heart, and plead in choicest language for permission to nestle
      there; and how the eyes softly permitted the bold student to look, and
      then loved to have him look, and, then consented that he might gaze at
      will&mdash;aye, for life!
    </p>
    <p>
      On a clear wintry night, while the wind of the lake whistled merrily
      across its congealed bosom, and the stars were looking down with clear
      faces into the bright icy mirror beneath&mdash;the sound of sweet music,
      and the tread of light feet resounded in the mansion of the old lawyer, by
      the broad lake side,&mdash;a &ldquo;merrie companie&rdquo; filled its halls, for John
      Earl, the no longer &ldquo;wandering typo,&rdquo; was about to become his son-in-law&mdash;or,
      son-in-love, as well as law&mdash;or both&mdash;and the bright eyes of one
      of Ohio's fairest daughters looked all confidingness and love, as she
      stood up before the assembled throng, and whispered herself into his
      possession. There was gay doings that night in this western mansion, and
      joy that age was a large partaker of; for the old pair, who sheltered the
      printer's orphan, years agone, and miles away, were guests within it, and
      their hearts swelled with pride, as they looked upon their adopted child,
      and his fair bride. The old shoemaker quietly remarked to his happy son,
      that no maid in the city stepped upon a more fairy foot, or wore so small
      a shoe; but he hoped to live long enough, to make a smaller size for the
      Earl family, and then he laughed as if the job would be a right merry one,
      and the purchaser of such a shoe, a favored customer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time has progressed since then, and we have listened to John Earl, Esq.,
      in the capital of his adopted state, as in clear tones, and patriotic
      fervor, he stood advocating the great truths of republican principles, and
      we have listened with pride and admiration, when those words proved that
      the child of the people, was the people's advocate. He did not, in his
      hour of prosperity, forget the lonely widow of the prairie, but had her
      and her little ones brought to Cleveland, and having by letters found her
      friends, he sent her home rejoicing&mdash;the little one to whom he last
      bid adieu in the wilderness still remembered him, and with her little lips
      pouting for a kiss, was the last again to bid him farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have traced our hero to the end of his wanderings, and leave him upon
      the stage of public action&mdash;on the road to eminence; and though many
      may read as though these words and scenes were the coinage of the writer's
      brain, yet let him assure those who so judge, that there be such &ldquo;streaks
      of life,&rdquo; in the book of a Typo's biography.

    <h2>
      &ldquo;NOT A DROP MORE, MAJOR, UNLESS IT'S SWEETEN'D.&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>n a small village,
      in the southern section of Missouri, resides a certain Major, who keeps a
      small, cosey, comfortable little inn, famous for its <i>sweeten'd drinks</i>,
      as well as jovial landlord; and few of the surrounding farmers visit the
      neighborhood, without giving the Major a friendly call, to taste his
      mixtur! The gay host, with jolly phiz, round person, bright eye, and
      military air, deals out the rations, spiced with jokes, which, if they are
      not funny, are at least laughed at, for the Major enjoys them so vastly
      himself, that his auditors are forced to laugh, out of pure sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      A good old couple, who resided about six miles from the Major's, for a
      long period had been in the habit of visiting him once a month, and as
      regularly went home dreadfully <i>sweeten'd</i> with the favorite mixtur',
      but of late, we learn, the amicable relations existing between the Major
      and his old visitors have been broken off by green-eyed jealousy. On the
      last visit, good cause was given for an end being put to any more &ldquo;sweet
      drinking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Merril, how are you, any how,&rdquo; was the Major's greeting, &ldquo;and I
      declare if the Missus aint with you, too&mdash;just as if he expected she
      wouldn't come. What'll you take Missus? shall I sweeten you a little of
      about the best Cincinnati rectified that ever was toted into these 'ere
      parts?&mdash;it jest looks as bright as your eyes!&rdquo; and here the Major
      winked and looked so sweet there was no resisting, and she did take a
      little sweeten'd.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hours flew merrilly by, and evening found the old couple so overloaded
      with sweets, that it was with great difficulty they could be seated on the
      old grey mare, to return home; but, after many a kind shake from the host,
      and just another drop of his sweeten'd, off they jogged, see-sawing from
      side to side on the critter, the old lady muttering her happiness, and the
      old man too full to find words to express himself.
    </p>

    <p>
      &ldquo;Sich another man as that Major,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;ain't nowhere&mdash;and sich
      a mixture as he does make, is temptin' to temperance lecturers. He is an
      amazin' nice man, and, if any thing, he sweetens the last drop better than
      the first. Good gracious! what a pleasin' creatur' he is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ever and anon these enconiums on the Major and his mixture broke from the
      old lady, until of a sudden, on passing a small rivulet, a jolt of the
      mare's silenced them, and the old man rode on a short distance in perfect
      quietness. At length he broke out with&mdash;&ldquo;Old woman, you and that 'ere
      Major's conduct, to-day, war rayther unbecomin'&mdash;his formalities war
      too sweet to be mistook, and you ain't goin' thar agin in a hurry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Silence, was the only answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you're huffy, are you?&rdquo; continued the old man. &ldquo;Well, I guess you can
      stay so, till you give in,&rdquo; and on he jogged, in a silently jealous mood.
      On arriving at the farm, he called to a negro to lift the old woman off,
      but Sam, the nigger, stood gazing at him in silent astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lift her oft', you Sam, do you hear?&mdash;and do it carefully., or some
      of her wrath'll bile out. In spite of the Major's sweetenin' she's mad as
      thunder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, de lor', massa, de ole 'oman aint dar,&rdquo; replied Sam, his eyes
      standing out of his countenance. &ldquo;Jest turn round, massa, and satisfy
      you'self dat de ole 'oman clar gone an missin&mdash;de lor'!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And sure enough, on a minute examination by the old man, she was &ldquo;found
      missing.&rdquo; The Major was charged at once with abduction, instant measures
      were taken for pursuit, and a party despatched to scour the roads. On
      proceeding about two miles on the road to the Major's, the party were
      suddenly halted at the small rivulet, by finding the Missus with her head
      lying partly in the little stream, its waters laving her lips, and softly
      murmuring&mdash;&ldquo;Not a drop more, Major, <i>unless it's sweeten'd!</i>&rdquo;

      NETTLE BOTTOM BALL; OR, BETSY JONES' TUMBLE IN THE MUSH PAN.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>ell, it are a
      fact, boys,&rdquo; said Jim Sikes, &ldquo;that I promised to tell you how I cum to git
      out in these Platte diggins, and I speculate you mout as well have it at
      onst, kase its bin troublin' my conscience amazin' to keep it kiver'd up.
      The afarr raised jessy in Nettle Bottom, and old Tom Jones' yell, when he
      swar he'd 'chaw me up,' gives my meat a slight sprinklin' of ager whenever
      I think on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, thar wur a small town called Equality, in Illimse, that some
      speckelators started near Nettle Bottom, cos thar wur a spontaneos salt
      lick in the diggins, and no sooner did they git it agoin' and build some
      stores and groceries thar, than they wragon'd from Cincinnate and other
      up-stream villages, a pacel of fellers to attend the shops, that looked as
      nice, all'ays, as if they wur goin' to meetin' or on a courtin' frolic;
      and 'salt their picters,' they wur etarnally pokin' up their noses at us
      boys of the Bottom. Well, they got up a ball in the village, jest to
      interduce themselves to the gals round the neighborhood, and invited a few
      on us to make a contrary picter to themselves, and so shine us out of site
      by comparison. Arter that ball thur wran't any thin' talked on among the
      gals but what nice fellers the clerks in Equality wur, and how nice and
      slick they wore their har, and their shiny boots, and the way they
      stirrupp'd down their trowsers. You couldn't go to see one on 'em, that
      she wouldn't stick one of these fellers at you, and keep a talkin' how
      slick they looked. It got to be parfect pizen to hear of, or see the
      critters, and the boys got together at last to see what was to be done&mdash;the
      thing had grown parfectly alarmin'. At last a meetin' was agreed on, down
      to old Jake Bents'.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On next Sunday night, instead of takin' the gals to meetin', whar they
      could see these fellers, we left 'em at home, and met at Jake's, and I am
      of the opinion thur was some congregated wrath thar&mdash;whew wan't they?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Oil and scissors!' says Mike Jelt, 'let's go down and lick the town,
      rite strait!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'No!' hollered Dick Butts, 'let's kitch these slick badgers comin' out of
      meetin', and tare the hide and feathers off on 'em!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Why, darn 'em, what d'ye think, boys,' busted in old Jake, 'I swar if
      they ain't larnt our gals to wear starn cuskins; only this mornin' I
      caught my darter Sally puttin' one on and tyin' it round her. She tho't I
      was asleep, but I seed her, and I made the jade repudiate it, and no
      mistake&mdash;quicker.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The boys took a drink on the occasion, and Equality town was slumberin',
      for a short spell, over a contiguous yearthquake. At last one of the boys
      proposed, before we attacked the town, that we should git up a ball in the
      Bottom, and jest out-shine the town chaps, all to death, afore we
      swallowed 'em. It was hard to gin in to this proposition, but the boys cum
      to it at last, and every feller started to put the afarr agoin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had been a long spell hankerin' arter old Tom Jones' darter, on the
      branch below the Bottom, and she was a critter good for weak eyes&mdash;maybe
      she hadn't a pair of her own&mdash;well, if they warn't a brace of movin'
      light-houses, I wouldn't say it&mdash;there was no calculatin' the extent
      or handsomeness of the family that gal could bring up around her, with a
      feller like me to look arter 'em. Talk about gracefulness, did you ever
      see a maple saplin' movin' with a south wind?&mdash;It warn't a crooked
      stick to compar' to her, but her old dad was awful. He could jest lick
      anythin' that said boo, in them diggins, out swar Satan, and was cross as
      a she bar, with cubs. He had a little hankerin' in favor of the fellers in
      town, too, fur they gin him presents of powder to hunt with, and he was
      precious fond of usin' his shootin' iron. I detarmin'd, anyhow, to ask his
      darter Betsy to be my partner at the Nettle Bottom Ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my sister Marth made me a bran new pair of buckskin trowsers to go
      in, and rile my pictur, ef she didn't put stirrups to 'em to keep 'em
      down. She said straps wur the fashion, and I should ware 'em. I jest felt
      with 'em on; as ef I had somethin' pressin' on me down&mdash;all my joints
      wur sot tight together, but Marth insisted, and I knew I could soon dance
      'em off, so I gin in, and started off to the branch for Betsy Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I arriv, the old fellar wur sittin' smokin' arter his supper, and
      the younger Jones' wur sittin' round the table, takin' theirs. A whappin'
      big pan of mush stood rite in the centre, and a large pan of milk beside
      it, with lots of corn bread and butter, and Betsy was helpin' the
      youngsters, while old Mrs. Jones sot by. admirin' the family collection.
      Old Tom took a hard star' at me, and I kind a shook, but the straps stood
      it, and I recovered myself, and gin him as good as he sent, but I wur near
      the door, and ready to break if he show'd fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'What the h&mdash;ll are you doin' in disgise,' says the old man&mdash;he
      swore dreadfully&mdash;'are you comin' down here to steal?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I riled up at that. Says I, 'ef I wur comin' fur sich purpose, you'd be
      the last I'd hunt up to steal off on.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'You're right,' says he, 'I'd make a hole to light your innards, ef you
      did.' And the old savage chuckled. I meant because he had nothin' worth
      stealin', but his darter, but he tho't 'twas cos I was afear'd on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, purty soon I gether'd up and told him what I cum down fur, and
      invited him to come up and take a drink, and see that all went on rite.
      Betsy was in an awful way fur fear he wouldn't consent. The old 'oman here
      spoke in favour of the move, and old Tom thought of the licker, and gin in
      to the measure. Off bounced Betsy up a ladder into the second story, and
      one of the small gals with her, to help put on the fixups. I sot down in a
      cheer, and fell a talkin' at the old 'oman. While we wur chattin' away as
      nice as relations, I could hear Betsy makin' things stand round above. The
      floor was only loose boards kivered over wide joice, and every step made
      'em shake and rattle like a small hurricane. Old Tom smoked away and the
      young ones at the table would hold a spoonful of mush to thur mouths and
      look at my straps, and then look at each other and snigger, till at last
      the old man seed 'em.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Well, by gun flints,' says he, 'ef you ain't makin' a josey-'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jest at that moment, somethin' gin way above, and may I die, ef Betsy,
      without any thin' on yearth on her but one of these starn cushins, didn't
      drop rite through the floor, and sot herself, flat into the pan of mush! I
      jest tho't fur a second, that heaven and yearth had kissed each other, and
      squeezed me between 'em. Betsy squealed like a 'scape pipe,&mdash;a spot
      of the mush had spattered on the old man's face, and burnt him, and he
      swore dreadful. I snatched up the pan of milk, and dashed it over Betsy to
      cool her off,&mdash;the old 'oman knocked me sprawlin' fur doing it, and
      away went my straps. The young ones let out a scream, as if the infarnal
      pit had broke loose, and I'd jest gin half of my hide to have bin out of
      the old man's reach. He did reach fur me, but I lent him one with my
      half-lows, on the smeller, that spread him, and maybe I didn't leave
      sudden! I didn't see the branch, but as I soused through it, I heerd Tom
      Jones swar he'd 'chaw me up, ef an inch big of me was found in them
      diggins in the mornin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did'nt know fur a spell whar I was runnin', but hearing nuthin' behind
      me, I slacked up, and jest considered whether it was best to go home and
      git my traps strait, and leave, or go see the ball. Bein' as I was a
      manager, I tho't I'd go have a peep through the winder, to see ef it cum
      up to my expectations. While I was lookin' at the boys goin' it, one on
      'em spied me, and they hauled me in, stood me afore the fire, to dry, and
      all hands got round, insistin' on knowin' what was the matter. I ups and
      tells all about it. I never heerd such laffin', hollerin', and screamin',
      in all my days.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jest then, my trowsers gin to feel the fire, and shrink up about an inch
      a minit, and the boys and gals kept it up so strong, laffin at my scrape,
      and the pickle I wur in, that I gin to git riley, when all at onst I seed
      one of these slick critters, from town, rite in among' em, hollerin' wuss
      than the loudest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Old Jones said he'd chaw you up, did he?' says the town feller, '<i>well,
      he allways keeps his word?</i>'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That minit I biled over. I grabbed his slick liar, and may be I didn't
      gin him scissors! Jest as I was makin' him a chawed specimen, some, feller
      holler'd out,&mdash;'don't let old Jones in with that ar rifle!' I didn't
      hear any more in that Bottom,&mdash;lightnin' could'nt a got near enough
      to singe my coat tail. I jumped through that winder as easy as a bar 'ud
      go through a cane brake; and cuss me if I could'nt hear the grit of old
      Jones' teeth, and smell his glazed powder, until I crossed old
      Massissippi.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      A &ldquo;CAT&rdquo; STORY, WHICH MUST NOT BE CUR-TAILED.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>en Snaggletree
      seated himself in our society the other day, overburdened with a
      Mississippi yarn, which embraced one of his hair breadth 'scapes, and
      which he had resolved on relieving his memory of, by having it chronicled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ben was an old Mississip' roarer&mdash;none of your half and half, but
      just as native to the element, as if he had been born in a broad horn. He
      said he had been fotched up on the river's brink, and &ldquo;knew a snappin'
      turtle from a snag, without larnin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One night,&rdquo; says Ben, &ldquo;about as dark as the face of Cain, and as unruly
      as if the elements had been untied, and let loose from their great
      Captain's command, I was on the old Mississippi; it was, in short, a night
      ugly enough to make any natural born Christian think of his prayers, and a
      few converted saints tremble&mdash;I walked out upon the steam boat
      'guard' to cool off from the effects of considerable liquor doin's,
      participated in during the day, but had scacely reached the side of the
      boat, when she struck a snag, and made a lurch, throwing me about six feet
      into the drink. I was sufficiently cool, stranger, when I came to the
      surface, but I had nigh, in a short time, set the Mississippi a bilin', my
      carcase grew so hot with wrath at observing the old boat wending her way
      up stream, unhurt, while I, solitary, unobserved, and alone, was floating
      on the old father of waters. I swam to the head of a small island, some
      distance below where we struck, and no sooner touched ground than I made
      an effort to stand erect. You may judge of my horror on discovering my
      landing place to be a Mississippi mud-bar, and about as firm as quicksand,
      into which I sunk about three feet in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All was dark as a stack of black cats&mdash;no object visible save the
      lights of the receding boat&mdash;no sound smote upon the ear but the
      lessening blow of the 'scape pipe, and the plashing of the surrounding
      waters;&mdash;the first sounded like the farewell voice of hope, while the
      latter, in its plashing and purling, was like to the jabbering of evil
      spirits, exulting over an entrapped victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I attempted to struggle, but that sunk me faster. I cried out, but
      fancied that, too, forced me deeper into my yielding grave; ere daylight
      dawned I felt sure of being out of sight, and the horrid thought of thus
      sinking into eternity through a mud-gate, made every hair stand 'on its
      own hook,' and forced my heart to patter against my ribs like a
      trio-hammer. I had been in many a scrape, but I considered this the
      nastiest, and made up my mind that the ball of yarn allotted to me was
      about being spun out&mdash;my cake was all mud! I promised old
      Mississippi, if permitted to escape this time, I would lick anythin' human
      that said a word agin her; but it was no use&mdash;she was sure of me now,
      and, like old 'bare bones' to an expiring African, she held on, and
      deeper, and deeper I sunk. In a short time I was forced to elevate my chin
      to keep out of my mouth an over-supply of the temperance liquid, which was
      flowing so coaxingly about my lips. My eyebrows were starting, my teeth
      set, and hope had wasted to a misty shadow, when something touched me like
      a floating solid; I instantly grasped it&mdash;it slid through my hands&mdash;<i>all
      but the tail</i>&mdash;which I clung to with a grip of iron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I soon discovered I had made captive a mammoth <i>catty</i>, huge enough
      to be the patriarch of his tribe, and a set of resolutions were quickly
      adopted in my mind, that he couldn't travel further without company. A
      desperate start and vigorous wiggle to escape was made by my friend, the
      catty, but there was six feet in length of desperation attached to his
      extremity, that could neither be coaxed or shook off. Soon succeeded
      another start, and out I came like a cork from a bottle. Off started the
      fish, like a comet, and after him I went, a muddy spark at the end of his
      tail. By a dexterous twist of his rudder, I succeeded in keeping him on
      the surface, and steered him to a solid landing, where I let him loose,
      and we shook ourselves, mutually pleased at parting company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do, Ben,&rdquo; said we, &ldquo;all but the tail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tail and all, or none!&rdquo; said Ben, so here you have it. Ben swears he'll
      father it himself.

    <h2>
      A SPIRITUAL SISTER, HER ENCOUNTER WITH A DOUBTFUL SMITH.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>here goes Smith,
      the Attorney,&rdquo; said a man to his friend; as a tall figure, slightly
      stooped, hurried by them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; answered the friend, &ldquo;that is the Rev. Mr. Smith, a
      preacher, I have heard him in Tennessee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well that's curious,&rdquo; replied the first, &ldquo;for I'd swear I have heard him
      plead at the bar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning Sol., how are you?&rdquo; salutes another, as he hurries by a
      group of citizens.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you call him?&rdquo; inquired one of the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Sol. Smith, was the answer&mdash;old Sol., the manager of the
      theatre, to-be-sure; who did you suppose it was?&mdash;I thought you knew
      him&mdash;every body knows old Sol!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well that is funny,&rdquo; answered the second, &ldquo;for I'll swear he officiated
      as a physician on board our boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well who the d&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;l is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This question was asked so frequently on board of a boat, recently, that
      those who didn't know became quite feverish, and those who did, kept dark
      to watch for a joke. Sol. had purchased a new hat&mdash;venerably broad in
      brim, of saintly and unostentatious height in crown, and it was easy to
      see that this new beaver was brewing him trouble. We feel almost inclined
      here to go into a disquisition upon hats, and the evils they have
      entailed, for who has not suffered, and been thrust out of the pale of
      good living, or cut in the street&mdash;or taken for a loafer, and asked
      by some dandy to hold his horse, or by some matron to carry home her
      market basket, and all because of a &ldquo;shocking bad hat.&rdquo; An &ldquo;old hat&rdquo; is,
      in fact, dangerous&mdash;so is a new one of a peculiar shape&mdash;so was
      Sol.'s broad brimmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      On board the steamer was a Mormon sister, on her way from down east to the
      holy city of Nauvoo, and many and anxious were her inquiries if any
      brother of the church was on board? None were able to inform her. At
      length the captain, at table, inquired:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I help you to a little of this roast beef, Mr. Smith?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, a small piece,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Smith,&rdquo; said the sister, &ldquo;Smith, that's a member, jest as shure as
      shutin'; I'll get interduced tu him arter a spell, and I reckon he'll turn
      eout tu be a shure enough brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arter a spell&rdquo; she did, through the kindness of the captain, get an
      introduction to him, and was previously informed by the commander, that
      Sol. was not only a shure enough Mormon, but an elder&mdash;in fact a
      Smith! Sol., as usual, was courteous and affable as when introduced to
      little Vic., at the court of St. James, and the sister was &ldquo;tickled all tu
      death&rdquo; at the idea of falling in with so pleasant an elder. She was a
      little ancient, but buxom, and Sol. felt flattered by her singling him out
      for an acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd a know'd in a minit that you was a member of the church by your
      countenance and your hat, Brother Smith, you do look so saintly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Ma'm,&rdquo; answered he, &ldquo;most people take me for a member.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was a thinkin' if you hadn't chosen a&mdash;he-he-he&mdash;a sister,
      why&mdash;&ldquo;&mdash;Puge 69.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's ony one thing, Brother Smith, which appears rayther queer about
      our church,&rdquo; said she, looking modestly at Sol., and biting the corner of
      her handkerchief, &ldquo;and that's the 'new system' they have interduced.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes,&mdash;y-e-s,&rdquo; said Sol., at fault, &ldquo;'new systems' do trouble
      the church a good deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Law, Brother Smith, do you think the 'speritual system' a trouble?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no, not exactly, if it's a good spiritual teaching,&rdquo; answered he,
      &ldquo;it's only the false doctrines that are evil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that's jest what Elder Adams sed down in eour parts, and he ses
      that it was speritually revealed tu the Prophet Joseph, your brother, and
      I was jest a thinkin',&rdquo; and here she spread her handkerchief over her
      face, and twisted her head to one side&mdash;&ldquo;I was a thinkin' if you
      hadn't chosen a&mdash;he-he-he!&mdash;a sister, why,&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;-

      &ldquo;We're at a landing, Ma'm, excuse me for a moment,&rdquo; and off shot Sol. to
      his state room, where he seized a pair of well worn saddle-bags, and his
      old hat, which he had thus far carried with him, intending to have it
      brushed up, and started for the gang-way plank. The captain met him in his
      haste, and inquired where he was going?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, captain,&rdquo; says Sol., &ldquo;I like your boat vastly, and you know I like
      you, but there might be a 'blow up' if I stayed on board much longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Explain,&rdquo; says the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, the fact is,&rdquo; said Sol., &ldquo;that lady you introduced me to has taken
      me for the Mormon Smith; now, I'm a good many Smith's when my family and
      titles are all collected, but I aint that Smith! Just tell her so for me,
      and give her my 'old hat'&mdash;it's the best I can do for her.&rdquo; We
      needn't add that Brother Smith was straightway among the missing!

    <h2>
      HOSS ALLEN'S APOLOGY; OR, THE CANDIDATE'S NIGHT IN A MUSQUITO SWAMP!
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>ell, old fellow,
      you're a hoss!&rdquo; is a western expression, which has grown into a truism as
      regards Judge Allen, and a finer specimen of a western judge, to use his
      constituents' language, &ldquo;aint no whar,&rdquo; for, besides being a sound jurist,
      he is a great wag, and the best practical joker within the circuit of six
      states. Among the wolf-scalp hunters of the western border of Missouri,
      Judge, or, as they more familiarly style him, Hoss Allen is all powerful
      popular, and the &ldquo;bar&rdquo; hunters of the southern section equally admire his
      free and easy manners&mdash;they consider him one of the people&mdash;none
      of your stuck-up imported chaps from the dandy states, but a real genuine
      westerner&mdash;in short, a hoss! Some of the Judge's admirers prevailed
      upon him, recently, to stand a canvass for the gubernatorial chair, in
      which he had Judge Edwards for an antagonist, and many are the rich jokes
      told of their political encounters. A marked difference characterizes the
      two men, and more striking opposites in disposition and demeanor would be
      hard to find, Edwards being slow, dignified, and methodical, while Hoss
      tosses dignity to the winds, and comes right down to a free and easy
      familiarity with the &ldquo;boys.&rdquo; Hoss Allen counted strong on the border
      counties, while his antagonist built his hopes on the centre.
    </p>
    <p>
      Allen and Edwards had travelled together for a number of days, explaining
      their separate views upon state government, at each regular place of
      appointment, and were now nearing the southern part of the state, a
      section where Hoss had filled the judgeship with great unction. Here he
      resolved to spring a joke upon his antagonist, which would set the south
      laughing at him, and most effectually insure his defeat among the bar
      hunters. He had been maturing a plan, as they journeyed together, and now
      having stopped for the night about one day's journey from the town of
      Benton, one of their places of appointment, and the head quarters of the
      most influential men of the bar section, Hoss proceeded to put his trick
      in progress of execution. He held a secret conference, at the stable, with
      the boy who took his horse, and offered him a dollar to take a message
      that night to Tom Walters, at the forks leading to Benton. The boy agreed,
      and Hoss penciled a note describing his antagonist, who was unknown in the
      south of the state, coupled with an earnest request, that he &ldquo;would keep a
      look out for Judge Eddards, and by all means be careful not to let him get
      into that cussed cedar swamp!&rdquo; His express was faithful, and in due time
      Tom received the missive. In the meantime, the victim, Edwards, in a sweet
      state of confidence, was unbending his dignity at hearing Hoss relate to
      their host his amusing yarns about the early settlers. Having talked all
      the household into a merry mood, he proposed turning in for the night, but
      first offered his service to unlace the girls' corsets, and in an
      underbreath asked the old woman to elope with him in the morning&mdash;Edwards
      blushed at this, the girls' tittered, and the host and his wife said, he
      was a &ldquo;raal hoss!&rdquo;&mdash;Allen acknowledged he was a leetle inclined that
      way, and as he had had his feed, he now wanted his straw.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning Hoss Allen became &ldquo;dreadful poorly,&rdquo; and it was with great
      difficulty he could be prevailed upon to get up. All were sympathising
      with his affliction, and the matron of the house boiled him some hot
      &ldquo;sass-tea,&rdquo; which, the old man said, relieved him mightily. Judge Edwards
      assured Hoss, that it would be necessary for him to lay up for a day or
      two, and the afflicted candidate signified the same, himself. Before they
      parted Hoss requested Edwards, as he had the whole field to himself, not
      to be too hard upon him. His antagonist promised to spare him, but
      chuckled all the while at having a clear field in Allen's most popular
      district. Shaking the old Hoss by the hand, as they were about to
      separate, he remarked&mdash;&ldquo;we will meet at Benton, I hope, in different
      trim, Friend Allen.&rdquo; They did meet in different trim, but Edwards little
      dreamed the particular kind of trim he would appear in. As soon as Judge
      Edwards was fairly started, it was surprising the rapid change which took
      place in his antagonist&mdash;Hoss' eye lit up, a broad grin spread over
      his features, and pulling off the handkerchief, which was tied around his
      head, he twirled it above him like a flag, then stuffed it in his pocket,
      remarking coolly, at the same time,&mdash;&ldquo;well, that thar swamp, jest at
      this season, is <i>awful!</i>&rdquo; His express reported himself after his
      night ride, assured Allen that all was O. K., and received his dollar for
      delivering the message, upon receiving which intelligence, Allen seated
      himself quietly and comfortably at his coffee, and imbibed it with a
      relish that drove the idea of sickness into a hopeless decline.
    </p>
    <p>
      Judge Edwards rapidly progressed on his way, highly gratified at having
      his opponent off in this part of the field, and as he, in this happy mood,
      journeyed onwards he set his brain to work conning a most powerful speech,
      one that would knock the sand from under Hoss, and leave him in a state of
      sprawling defeat. He resolved to sweep the south, from that point, like a
      prairie fire. About noon, or perhaps an hour after, he arrived at Tom
      Walters' for dinner, and while it was preparing, inquired how far he was
      from Benton?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've an idea,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;you're well onto nine miles frum thar&mdash;jest
      an easy arternoon ride.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was highly satisfactory to the Judge, and perceiving that the
      provender preparing was of alike pleasing character, he spread himself
      back upon a hickory bottomed chair with a kind of easy dignity, at once
      comfortable to himself, and edifying to his host.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stranger,&rdquo; inquired Tom, &ldquo;did you scare up anythin' like the two
      candidates, Jedge Eddards and old Hoss Allen, on your way down yeur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did see something of them, my friend,&rdquo; answered the Judge, and then, as
      if making up his mind to surprise Tom, and give him a striking example of
      democratic condescension, he inquired, &ldquo;would you know either of the
      gentlemen, if they stood before you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, as to old Hoss,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;I don't know anybody else, but this new
      Jedge I ain't never seed, and ef he is the slicked up finefied sort on a
      character they pictur' him, I don't want to see him&mdash;Its my opinion,
      these squirtish kind a fellars ain't perticular hard baked, and they
      allers goes in fur aristocracy notions.&rdquo; The Judge had no idea that Tom
      was smoking him, and he congratulated himself that an opportunity here
      presented itself, where he could remove a wrong impression personally; so,
      loftily viewing this southern constituent, he remarked:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have heard a calumny, my friend, for Judge Edwards now sits before
      you, and you can see whether his appearance denotes such a person as you
      describe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; shouted Tom, with mock surprise, &ldquo;you aint comin' a hoax over a
      fellar?&mdash;you raally are the sure enough Jedge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am really the Judge, my friend,&rdquo; responded his honor, highly elevated
      with Tom's astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then gin us your paw,&rdquo; shouted Tom, &ldquo;you're jest the lookin' fellar kin
      sweep these yeur diggins like a catamount! What in the yearth did you do
      with old Hoss on the road? I heerd he was a comin' along with you. He aint
      gin out, has he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Judge replied, with a smile which expressed disparagement of Hoss
      Allen's powers of endurance, that he was forced to lie up on the route,
      from fatigue. Dinner being announced as ready the Judge and Tom seated
      themselves, and the latter highly expanded his guest's prospects in the
      district, assuring him that he could lick Hoss &ldquo;powerful easy, ef he
      wasn't broken winded.&rdquo; The meal being ended, the Judge demanded his horse,
      and inquired of his host the direct road to Benton, which Tom thus mapped
      out:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arter you pass the big walnut, about two miles from yeur, keep it a mile
      on your left, and take the right trail fur about six hundred yards, when
      you'll cum to the 'saplin acre,' thar you keep to the right agin, and when
      that trail fotches you up, why right <i>over from thar</i> lies Benton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was a very clear direction to one who had never before travelled the
      road, but the Judge, trusting to luck, said, &ldquo;he thought he would be able
      to get there without much difficulty,&rdquo; and started off, leaving his late
      entertainer gazing after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I allow you will, Jedge,&rdquo; chuckled Tom,&mdash;&ldquo;You'll git inter
      that swamp, jest as sure as shootin', and you'll hev the biggest and
      hungryest audience of mosquitors, ever a candidate preached law or larnin'
      to!&rdquo; To secure his finding the swamp road, he had stationed his boy Jim
      near the turn off, to make the matter sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of a couple of hours along came Hoss Allen, who, as soon as
      Tom took hold of his bridle, winked his eye at him while he inquired:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Jedge Eddards come along, Tom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he did, Hoss, oncommon extensive in his political feelins'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you didn't let the Jedge stray away from the swamp road?&rdquo; inquired
      Hoss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I predicate I didn't, fur by this time he's travellin' into the
      diggins most amazin' innocently,&rdquo; and then the pair enjoyed a regular
      guffaw!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's safe as a skin'd bar, then, Tom, and I'll spread his hide afore the
      Benton boys to-morrow&mdash;jest let them into the joke, and I allow,
      after that, his dandified aristocracy speeches won't have much effect in
      this section.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go it, Jedge,&rdquo; shouted Tom, &ldquo;ef I ain't thar to hear it, it'll be 'cause
      the breath'll leave me afore then&mdash;gin him goss without sweeten'&mdash;rumple
      his har, but don't spile the varmint!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After Hoss had stayed his stomach with a cold bite, he bade Tom good-day,
      and started for Benton, highly tickled with the success of his trick. As
      he neared the &ldquo;saplnracre,&rdquo; he met Jim, who exhibited a full spread of his
      ivories, when Hoss. inquired which road he had directed the gentleman
      before him?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He gone into de swamp road, massa, but what de debil he want dar, 'cept
      he arter coon skins, dis niggah doesn't hab no idear, whatsomedeber.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Allen passed on, assured that all was right, and as his horse leisurely
      ambled forward, he broke into singing a verse of a western ditty, which
      says:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Thar aint throughout this western nation,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Another like old Hickory
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He was bom jest fur his siteation&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      A bold leader of the free.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      As night spread her curtain over this wild district, Hoss neared Benton,
      and as his nag jogged up the principal street, he broke out into a louder
      strain, repeating the above verse, on hearing which, the &ldquo;boys,&rdquo; who were
      expecting him and Edwards, turned out, and old Hoss was received with a
      cheer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Jedge!&mdash;How are you, Old Hoss?&mdash;Give us your paw,
      Governor!&mdash;Here at last, Squire!&rdquo;&mdash;and sundry such expressions
      of familiar welcome was showered on Allen, by the crowd. &ldquo;Come in, and git
      a drink, old fellar,&rdquo; shouted one of the crowd, and forthwith all hands
      pushed for the hotel bar room, where sweetened corn juice was pushed about
      with vast liberality&mdash;at the <i>candidate's</i> expense, of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whar did you leave the new fellar, Jedge Eddards?&rdquo; was the general
      inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, boys, I stopped to rest on the road, and he slid off to git ahead of
      me&mdash;I heered on him at the forks, and expected he was here. It's my
      opinion, boys, he's seen a bar on the road, and bein' too delicate to make
      the varmint clar the path, he's taken a long circuit round him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This raised a laugh among the crowd, and it was followed up by general
      inquiries as to what Edwards looked like, but to these Hoss shook his
      head, remarking, as he raised his hands expressive of how they would be
      astonished&mdash;&ldquo;jest wait tell you see him yourselves, boys, and then
      you'll be satisfied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Let us return to Judge Edwards, who had easily found his way past the
      &ldquo;sapling acre,&rdquo; and by the aid of Jim's direction progressed into the
      swamp road, as easy as if it were his destination. Having travelled, as he
      thought, about ten miles, he began to look out for Benton, and every now
      and then uttered an expression of surprise, that they had located the town
      in such a swampy country&mdash;every rod he progressed became more and
      more obscure, the brush more thick and wild in growth, and the ground more
      moist and yielding. Night, too, that season for the rendezvous of
      underbrush and tangle-wood horrors, was fast gathering its forces in the
      depths of the forest, and beneath the shadows of the thick bushes,
      shrouding, as with a dark mist, each object on the earth's surface,
      creeping up the trunks of the old trees, and noiselessly stealing away the
      light in which they had proudly spread their green foliage, while in lieu
      of their showy garb he clad them in a temporary mourning. The song of the
      birds became hushed, while the cry of the startled wolf was borne upon the
      breeze to the ear of the affrighted traveller, interrupted occasionally by
      the sharp <i>m-e-o-w!</i> of the wild-cat, making together a vocal concert
      most unharmonious to the ear of the bewildered candidate. To sum up these
      horrors a myriad of <i>mosquitoes</i>, as musical as hunger and vigorous
      constitutions could make them, hummed and fi-z-z-zed around him, darting
      in their stings and darting away from his annoyed blows, with a
      pertinacity and perseverance only known to the Missouri tribe of insects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Edwards!&mdash;he was fairly in for it&mdash;into a swamp at that!&mdash;Night
      was fast making all roads alike obscure, and with amazing rapidity
      covering our traveller in a mantle of uncertainty. The possibility of his
      escape that night first became improbable, and then impossible. He
      hallooed at the highest pitch of his voice, but the wolf was the only live
      varmint that answered his cry, and a strange fear began to creep over his
      heart. He remembered well reading accounts of where hungry droves of these
      animals had eaten the horse from under the saddle, the rider upon it,
      bones, hide, <i>har</i> and all, leaving scarce a vestige of the victims
      to mark the deed, and his hair grew uneasy on his cranium at the bare
      thought of such an unpolitical termination to his canvass. At this
      particular moment a yell, as of a thousand devils in his immediate
      neighbourhood, set his heart knocking against his ribs in a fearful
      manner. When he partially recovered from the shock he tied his horse to
      one tree and quickly mounted another&mdash;whispering the hope to his
      heart, at the same time, that a meal on his horse would satisfy the
      gathering crowd of varmints, who were shouting their death song below him.
      Having seated himself astride a limb, the mosquitoes had a fair chance at
      him, and they put the Judge through as active an exercise as ever was
      inflicted on a recruit&mdash;there was this difference, however, between
      him and a recruit, they are generally raw at the commencement of a drill,
      but poor Edwards was most raw at the end of his lesson. Every new yell of
      the swamp pre-emptioners, made him climb a limb higher, and each
      progression upwards appeared to introduce him to a fresh and hungrier
      company of mosquitoes&mdash;the trees in the swamp were like the dwellings
      in Paris, their highest tenants were the most needy. Day at length broke,
      and our harassed candidate, almost exhausted, clambered from his exalted
      position. His frightened but unscathed steed uttered a neigh of welcome as
      he bestrode him, and giving loose to the rein he committed his escape to
      the animal's sagacity, while he aided his efforts by a devout
      supplication. Accident favored the horse's footsteps, for striking the
      trail leading to the road he started off into a trot, and soon broke his
      rider's spell of terror, by turning into the main avenue leading to
      Benton. Edwards slowly passed his pimpled hand over his worse pimpled
      face, sadly remarking:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last night's 'bills' all passed, for I bear their stinging signatures all
      over my countenance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When ten o'clock came, on the day following Judge Allen's arrival at
      Benton, the town swarmed with the southern constituency of Missouri, and
      as soon as the tavern bell, which had been put in requisition to announce
      the candidate's readiness, had ceased its clamor, Hoss mounted the balcony
      of the hotel, and rolling up his sleeves &ldquo;spread himself&rdquo; for an unusually
      brilliant effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys!&rdquo; shouted he, &ldquo;I want your attention to matters of vital import&mdash;of
      oncommon moment, and replete with a nation's <i>welfar</i>.&rdquo; Here looking
      down into the crowd at Sam Wilson, who was talking as loud as he could
      bellow, about an imported heifer he had just bought, Hoss called his
      attention: &ldquo;Sam,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you'd better bring that heifer of your'n up
      here to address the meetin', and I'll wait till the animal gits through!&rdquo;
       This raised a laugh on Sam, and Hoss proceeded. After dilating at some
      length on the imported candidate who was his antagonist, he &ldquo;<i>let
      himself out</i>,&rdquo; on some of the measures he advocated, and particularly
      dwelt on the fact that he went in for creating a license law on hunting
      varmints!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you have the least mite of an idea, boys,&rdquo; said Hoss, &ldquo;that this
      creatur' of a faction wants to have every man's rifle stamped with the
      state arms, and then made pay a license to the state before he can git a
      bonus for wolf scalps.&rdquo; [At this moment a shrill voice interrupted him
      again&mdash;a girl belonging to the hotel was shouting to a couple of
      youngsters, who had been despatched to the barn for eggs, to &ldquo;quit suckin'
      them thar eggs or the candidates would stand a mighty small chance furthur
      dinner.&rdquo;] &ldquo;Jest tell that gall,&rdquo; said Hoss, &ldquo;to suck my share and stop her
      screamin.&rdquo; He again continued: &ldquo;I want to know what in yearth this
      Massissippi country's comin' too, when sich fellars finds favor with the
      people&mdash;what do you think of him boys?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, <i>cuss his pictur!</i>&rdquo; was the general response from the <i>bar</i>
      hunters.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Hoss was thus arousing public indignation against his antagonist, a
      stranger entered the crowd, and after listening a moment to the speaker's
      imaginary flights he interrupted him by shouting:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I deny your assertions, Judge Allen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was a bomb shell, and the crowd cleared a space round the stranger,
      in expectation of a fight; but Allen after surveying the stranger, in whom
      he recognised his antagonist Edwards, coolly inquired why he disputed it?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, me!&rdquo; shouted Edwards, &ldquo;who can better declare your assertions false
      than the man you are misrepresenting&mdash;you know very well that I am
      that Judge Edwards!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hoss Allen turned calmly round to the crowd and said:&mdash;&ldquo;Boys, you
      know I never git angry at a man insane or in liquor, and as I don't know
      this fellar, and never seed him afore in my life, its the best proof that
      he aint Jedge Eddards, so you'll oblige me by taking him off the ground
      and keeping him from disturbing the meeting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Expostulation was useless&mdash;without any ceremony he was carried into
      the hotel, boiling with indignation. There, however, he had to stay, at a
      convenient distance to hear that Allen was giving him &ldquo;<i>particular jesse</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After the meeting adjourned three cheers were given for Hoss Allen, and
      all parties gathered into the bar to take a little <i>fluid</i>, and
      discuss the speech. Edwards having now been relieved from durance, started
      for Hoss;&mdash;burning inside with choler and smarting exteriorly from
      mosquito-bites,&mdash;he looked bitter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you say you don't know me, Judge Allen?&rdquo; inquired he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hoss looked steadily at him, then coolly taking out his spectacles, he
      wiped the glasses, adjusted them upon his nose, and surveyed the
      questioner from head to foot, he then remarked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thar is somethin' about your voice, and the clothes you ware, that I
      ought to know&mdash;Jedge Eddards wore a coat and kerseys exactly like
      your'n, but I'll swar he had a better lookin' face than you carry when we
      parted yesterday mornin'. If you are him you're been the wust used
      candidate I've seed in an age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; responded Edwards, &ldquo;thanks to that d&mdash;n nigger that sent me
      into the swamp. I tell you sir that I have passed a night to which the
      infernal regions are a scant pattern, and between mosquitoes, wolves, and
      wild-cats I should not be surprised if my hair had turned grey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I begin to re-cognise you, now, Jedge,&rdquo; said Hoss, in a sympathetic tone,
      &ldquo;and no wonder I didn't know you at first sight&mdash;your head is swelled
      as big as a <i>pumkin!</i> I'll do the clean thing, Jedge,&rdquo; said Hoss,
      starting for the balcony, &ldquo;I'll apologise afore the boys, publicly, for
      not knowin' you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; shouted Edwards, who knew his apology would only place his
      night's adventure in a more ridiculous light, &ldquo;I don't demand any
      apology.&rdquo; But he was too late, Hoss had already called the attention of
      the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;as an honourable man who finds himself in the wrong, I
      am bound to apologise, publicly, to my friend Jedge Eddards,&mdash;the
      Jedge is a leetle changed in appearance since we wur last together, and I
      did not re-cognise him; I, tharfore, ask his pardon fur orderin' him off
      the ground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I grant it!&rdquo; shouted Edwards, glad here to wind up the apology, then
      turning round he added, &ldquo;come boys, let us drink good friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minit, boys,&rdquo; said Hoss, &ldquo;the Jedge and I havin' smoothed that
      little marter over, I jest want to tell you why I didn't know him at fust
      sight. You all know that the mosquitoes in cedar swamp are an oreful
      hungry breed, and when they git a passenger they present him with numerous
      'relief bills;' well I had gained considerable popularity in that swamp,
      by presentin' their condition before the legislatur' and askin' for reliet
      for the distressed inhabitants,&mdash;the Jedge, to head me down thar,
      passed all last night on a limb of one of the trees makin' stump speeches

      elected he has accepted all their <i>mosquito bills!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One tremendous shout rent the air, followed by bursts of laughter, from
      which Edwards retreated into the hotel. We have but to add that Hoss
      carried the Bar counties &ldquo;as easy as rolling off a log!&rdquo; His antagonist in
      vain tried to stem the tide of fun,&mdash;when he essayed to speak a
      m-e-o-w of a wild-cat or the hum of a mosquito imitated by some of his
      audience would be sure to set the rest sniggering, and spoil his effort.

    <h2>
      NATURAL ACTING! DAN MARBLE'S FIRST APPEARANCE AT GRAND RIVER, MICHIGAN.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>everal years since
      our friend Dan Marble, the celebrated representative of Yankee characters,
      was performing an engagement at Detroit, and was persuaded by some friends
      to take a trip to Chicago, and give them a taste of his quality in the
      lake city. Dan consented, and on board of the good steamer Constitution,
      commanded by a skilful captain, under the care of Doty, one of the best
      lake engineers, and piloted by Gus. McKinstry, they set out in the fall of
      the year for their northern destination. All went &ldquo;merry as a marriage
      bell;&rdquo; they had a successful trip up,&mdash;Dan had a successful
      engagement&mdash;and back they started for Detroit. But now the elements
      became rebellious; whether rude Boreas resolved to keep this favorite son
      of Momus up there in his northern home, we know not, but when the vessel
      that bore his fortunes&mdash;his own comical self&mdash;had nearly reached
      the head of the lake, against a head wind that would almost tear off a
      shirt collar, they run out of wood, and was forced to scud back to
      Milwaukee a &ldquo;leetle dust faster than they wanted tu.&rdquo; They loaded up with
      the fuel again, and shutting their teeth with determination, they fastened
      tight the safety valve, and tried it again right in the teeth of the
      hurricane. After puffing, and blowing, and wheezing, and coughing, the old
      boat had to give in, and hunt a harbor. Fate drove them into Grand River&mdash;we
      say, Fate did it, in order, as we think, to keep up the character of a
      grand stream by opening a dramatic temple on its banks, with an exhibition
      of the budding greatness of a genius. Fate, you know, has the ordering of
      such things.
    </p>
    <p>
      The noble steamer came to anchor in the quiet river, between its towering
      sand banks, and old &ldquo;blow hard&rdquo; tossed the lake wave on the outside,
      top-mast high, with glee, at having penned Dan. Down came an inhabitant of
      the town of Grand River, who had seen Dan perform at Buffalo, and
      recognising him, up he posted to spread the news. In the meantime, those
      on board were wondering how they should pass the weary hours, if the
      fierce wind continued its fury. Presently, down comes another resident to
      the boat, a small <i>cat-skin</i> cap on his head, a Canada-mixed coat on,
      and dressed in <i>deer-skin breeches.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whar is he?&mdash;which is him?&mdash;consarn his comic pictur, show him
      out&mdash;ha-ha-ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you lookin' after, Mister?&rdquo; inquired the pilot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why Dan&mdash;corn twist him&mdash;Dan Marble, to be sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, here I am, old fellar,&rdquo; answered the pilot, &ldquo;take a look at me!&rdquo;
       The pilot weighed about two hundred and twenty-two pounds, and had on an
      old sou-wester tarpaulin. Back stepped the inhabitant of Grand River, as
      if to get a good look, and take in all his dimensions at one stare. Gus,
      the pilot, made a wry face at his cat-skin observer, and out he burst:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha-ha-ha!&mdash;ho-ho-ho!&mdash;he-he-he!&mdash;cuss me ef you ain't jest
      as I heerd on you&mdash;we've got you, have we? ha-ha-ha!&mdash;stop till
      I go and get the fellars, and by grist mills you'll have to gin us a
      playin'!&rdquo; and forthwith off started the cat-skin cap and deer-skin
      breeches, their owner pausing every hundred yards to ejaculate&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha-ha!&mdash;we've got him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a short time he returned, sure enough, and half the town with him. A
      number of the business men of the place waited upon Dan, proper, and
      requested that he would amuse them, and pass away his own time, by
      relating some of his Yankee stories, singing songs, &amp;c., tendering
      him, at the same time, the second story of a storehouse for his theatre.
      Dan consented, and all hands on board entering into the spirit of the
      thing, they soon constructed a temporary stage, with a sail for a back
      scene and the American flag for a curtain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Night came, and with its shadows came the inhabitants of the town of Grand
      River&mdash;the owner of the cat-skin cap and his party, among the
      number.'
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to make his performance varied, Dan made arrangements to produce
      the <i>skunk scene</i>, from the &ldquo;Water Witch;&rdquo; and drilled Doty, the
      engineer, Gus, the pilot, the clerk of the boat, and the mate, to perform
      the English sailors in the scene. It will be remembered by those who have
      witnessed it, that they catch the Yankee just as he has killed a skunk,
      and are about to press him as a sailor; he persuades them to see a
      specimen of his shooting&mdash;they stick up the dead animal as a mark,
      and while he gets their attention upon the object in one direction, he
      retreats in the other, showing off in his exit a specimen of &ldquo;tall
      walking.&rdquo; After considerable drilling his assistants were pronounced
      perfect; but the pilot swore that, to play an English sailor, he must get
      disguised, so accordingly he primed with a double quantity of grog. His
      associates, jealous of his natural acting, say he had to get drunk before
      he could look at the audience. Up went the curtain, and on went Dan; of
      course the audience were amused&mdash;they couldn't help it; but cat-skin
      looked in vain for his Dan. At length the skunk scene opened, and on came
      the pilot at the head of his party. The deer-skin breeches could hardly
      hold their owner; he ha-ha'd and ho-ho'd as if he would go into fits. Gus
      clapped his eye upon him, and screwed up his face into as many lines as a
      map, which finished the effect with cat-skin&mdash;he rolled off his seat,
      almost convulsed. Now commenced the scene with Yankee Dan, and when he
      told Gus to stoop down and watch his shot, it was with considerable
      difficulty that the pilot balanced himself in any such position. While
      they were stooping, off started Dan in their rear, and, to keep up the
      scene, off they started in pursuit; Dan, according to plot, hid behind the
      r. h. wing, front&mdash;his pursuers should here pass him and cross the
      stage, allowing him, by a Yankee trick, to escape; but that portion of the
      plot Gus, the pilot, had forgotten; he, therefore, came to a dead halt and
      looked round for Dan; there he was, and out shouted Gus: &ldquo;Come out, old
      fellar&mdash;I see you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dan shook his head and signed for them to go on. &ldquo;No you don't,&rdquo; says the
      pilot; &ldquo;we caught you fair, and I'm be d&mdash;d if you shan't treat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The effect was irresistible; Dan had to give in, and the curtain dropped
      before a delighted audience&mdash;a-collapsed pair of deer-skin breeches,
      and upon the first night of the drama in Grand River. The owner of the
      cat-skin cap and deer-skin breeches maintains, to this day, that the pilot
      was Dan Marble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Them other fellars,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;done pooty well, but any 'coon, with half
      an eye, could see that that fat fellar did the naturalest acting!&rdquo;

      A CANAL ADVENTURE.
    </h2>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Oh hapless our fate was, each one and all,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      For we were wreck-ed on the Erie Canal,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      Old Ballad.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>n an evening in
      the month of July, 1836, I embarked at Lockport, in company with some
      fourteen passengers, on board an Erie Canal packet, destined for
      Rochester. It will be remembered that this was during the great migrating
      period in the United States, when all nations and pursuits had
      representatives on our principal travelling routes. Our party was no
      sooner aboard than the &ldquo;bold captain&rdquo; gave the word, the horses were got
      &ldquo;under weigh,&rdquo; the feathers set, and all hands called to pick out their
      shelf&mdash;a six foot-by-one convenience, suspended by cords&mdash;upon
      which they stowed away passengers for the night. Babel never heard a
      greater confusion of tongues than this call set wagging. But above them
      all was heard the silver tone of a travelling exquisite, piping out:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I-aw am first, cap'en, really,&mdash;I claim pwior choice, I do, dem if I
      don't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Happening to be first on the register, it was accorded, and the captain
      suggested a locker berth, as the most comfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! no!&mdash;dem,&mdash;beg you-a pawden, cap'en,&rdquo; shouted the
      exquisite, &ldquo;some gwos, fat individual, might get on the upa shelf and
      bweak down,&mdash;I should be mangled howibly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be jabers, I'd like to hev the squazin of him, me-silf,&rdquo; said a burly
      Irishman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They'd better spill a leettle smellin' stuff on the pesky animal, or
      he'll spile before mornin',&rdquo; chimed in a Yankee.
    </p>
    <p>
      After sundry remarks, at the exquisite's expense, and considerable
      confusion, all were duly ticketed for the night, and commenced piling
      themselves away like pledges in a pawnbroker's shop. Jonathan and the
      Irishman carelessly spread themselves upon a couple of long cane-bottomed
      settees, which occupied the centre of the cabin, and, in a very brief
      space of time, the company hushed into silence, save an occasional short
      blessing bestowed upon the short berths. When all appeared to have dropped
      into forgetfulness, the head of a way-passenger was thrust into the cabin
      entrance, with the inquiry&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any berths here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, this is the <i>gintlemen's</i> cabin,&rdquo; answered the Irishman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I want to know if there's any berths here?&rdquo; reiterated the
      inquirer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Divil a chance for wan here,&rdquo; was the response; &ldquo;don't I tell ye this is
      the <i>gintlemen's</i> cabin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This conversation partially aroused the sleepers, who inquired of the
      Emeralder what was the row?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some botherin' docthur,&rdquo; was the sleepily muttered reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      All soon again relapsed into quiet;&mdash;snore began to answer snore, in
      &ldquo;high and boastful blowing,&rdquo; and I turned my back to the lamp for the
      purpose of making a somnolent effort, individually. After tossing and
      turning for some time, I found that the plentiful supper taken at Lockport
      had entered a veto against sleep for me, and every effort failed to
      accomplish more than a drowsy lethargy, which still left the senses
      partially awake. A strange bumping noise aided to keep me in this state,
      and I was labouring to assign a cause for the sound, when a voice
      distinctly cried out&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's no use a pumpin', captin', and I <i>won't!</i> She may sink and be
      <i>dern'd!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The concluding part of this remark started my senses into activity, and,
      after an effort, I turned round on my foot-wide couch, and took a survey
      of my &ldquo;sleeping partners,&rdquo; to observe how the voice had affected them; but
      not a muscle moved&mdash;all were chorussing beautifully the lays of
      dream-land. The certainty' of our &ldquo;sinking and be dern'd,&rdquo; was soon
      apparent, for the light of the lamp, suspended from the ceiling of the
      cabin, soon began to be reflected from the floor&mdash;the waters were
      quietly stealing upon the unconscious sleepers. My first impulse was to
      sound the alarm, but, fortunately, possessing a &ldquo;top shelf,&rdquo; and conscious
      that we could sink but a few feet, I held my peace until the water should
      increase its depth, being sure of fun when I gave the signal.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pair of boots now commenced a very fair forward-two to a boot-jack which
      was busily engaged in executing a chassez before a nodding hat,&mdash;stockings
      were wriggling about, as if pleased with the fun, and, in a few minutes
      more, all was a scene of life among the sleepers' &ldquo;unconsidered trifles&rdquo;
       of wardrobe carelessly cast upon the floor. The water having reached
      within a few inches of the slumbering pair upon the cane-bottomed settees,
      I sounded the alarm, by shouting&mdash;&ldquo;Murder! boat's sinking! hurrah!
      help!&rdquo; Off tumbled the Irishman and Yankee&mdash;splash&mdash;dash&mdash;flounder
      and exclamation!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holy Virgin! what's this?&rdquo; inquired Pat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cre-a-tion and the deluge!&rdquo; shouted Jonathan &ldquo;Good gwacious!&rdquo; piped in
      the dandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down hopped the tenants of the shelves, like bodies in a family vault at
      the general rising&mdash;up again they hopped, light as spirits and twice
      as natural, the instant their pedal extremities touched the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take it cool, gentlemen,&rdquo; shouted a westerner, from a top berth, &ldquo;these
      are the canal extras.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A lady, at this moment, parted the curtains of their cabin&mdash;the
      Emeralder, with true gallantry, seized her in his arms, with a shout of
      &ldquo;Riscue the ladies!&rdquo; and bore her out on deck. Jonathan, not to be outdone
      by a foreigner, stood ready for the second, but her weight (only two
      hundred pounds) put a stumper on his gallantry. Yankee ingenuity, however,
      overcame the difficulty,&mdash;by making a bridge of the cane settees, the
      ladies were safely conducted from their watery quarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a funny scene on deck, that night, and little ceremony was observed
      in making a toilet. None, however, seemed to take the matter seriously but
      the dandy&mdash;he had lost all his beautifying essentials, in the
      confusion, and was almost frightened to death at his hair-breadth 'scape.
      Jonathan was offering him some crumbs of comfort, to induce him to make a
      purchase for his future safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell you what, Mister,&rdquo; says Jonathan, &ldquo;jest buy one of my
      everlastin'-no-drownin'-dry-and-water-tight-life-presarvers, and when you
      git it <i>fixed right</i>, it'll keep you so dry you'll have to sprinkle
      yourself to <i>stick together.</i>&rdquo;

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>t Buffalo Head,
      Nianga county, state of Missouri, during the canvass of 1844, there was
      held an extensive political <i>Barbecue</i>, and the several candidates
      for congress, legislature, county offices, &amp;c., were all congregated
      at this southern point for the purpose of making an immense demonstration.
      Hards, softs, whigs and Tylerites were represented, and to hear their
      several expositions of state and general policy, a vast gathering of the
      Missouri sovereigns had also assembled. While the impatient candidates
      were awaiting the signal to mount the &ldquo;stump,&rdquo; an odd-looking old man made
      his appearance at the brow of a small hill bounding the place of meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurrah for old <i>Sugar!</i>&rdquo; shouted an hundred voices, while on,
      steadily, progressed the object of the cheer.

    </h5>
    <p>
      <i>Sugar</i>, as he was familiarly styled, was an old man, apparently
      about fifty years of age, and was clad in a coarse suit of brown
      linsey-woolsey. His pants were patched at each knee, and around the ankles
      they had worn off into picturesque points&mdash;his coat was not of the
      modern close-fitting cut, but hung in loose and easy folds upon his broad
      shoulders, while the total absence of buttons upon this garment, exhibited
      the owner's contempt for the storm and the tempest. A coarse shirt, tied
      at the neck with a piece of twine, completed his body covering. His head
      was ornamented with an old woollen cap, of divers colors, below which
      beamed a broad, humorous countenance, flanked by a pair of short, funny
      little grey whiskers. A few wrinkles marked his brow, but time could not
      count them as sure chronicles of his progress, for Sugar's hearty,
      sonorous laugh oft drove them from their hiding place. Across his shoulder
      was thrown a sack, in each end of which he was bearing to the scene of
      political action, a keg of <i>bran new whiskey</i>, of his own
      manufacture, and he strode forward on his moccason covered feet,
      encumbered as he was, with all the agility of youth. Sugar had long been
      the standing candidate of Nianga county, for the legislature, and founded
      his claim to the office upon the fact of his being the first &ldquo;squatter&rdquo; in
      that county&mdash;his having killed the first bar there, ever killed by a
      white man, and, to place his right beyond cavil, he had 'stilled the first
      keg of whiskey! These were strong claims, which urged in his comic rhyming
      manner would have swept the &ldquo;diggins,&rdquo; but Sugar, when the canvass opened,
      always yielded his claim to some liberal purchaser of his fluid, and duly
      announced himself a candidate for the next term.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here you air, old fellar!&rdquo; shouted an acquaintance, &ldquo;allays on hand 'bout
      'lection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Nat.,&rdquo; said Sugar, &ldquo;you've jest told the truth as easy as ef you'd
      taken sum of my mixtur&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      'Whar politicians congregate,

     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Set him up!&mdash;set the old fellar up somewhar, and let us take a
      univarsal liquor!&rdquo; was the general shout.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on, boys,&mdash;keep cool and shady,&rdquo; said old Sugar, &ldquo;whar's the
      candidates?&mdash;none of your splurgin round till I git an appropriation
      fur the sperits. Send em along and we'll negotiate fur the fluid, arter
      which I shall gin 'em my instructions, and they may then per-cede to

     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The candidates were accordingly summoned up to pay for Sugar's portable
      grocery, and to please the crowd and gain the good opinion of the owner,
      they made up a purse and gathered round him. Sugar had placed his two kegs
      upon a broad stump and seated himself astride of them, with a small tin
      cup in his hand and a paper containing brown sugar lying before him&mdash;each
      of his kegs was furnished with a spiggot, and as soon as the money for the
      whole contents was paid in, Sugar commenced addressing the crowd as
      follows:

      &ldquo;Boys, fellars, and candidates,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I, Sugar, am the furst white
      man ever seed in these yeur diggins&mdash;I killed the furst bar ever a
      white skinned in this county, and I kalkilate I hev hurt the feelings of
      his relations sum sence, as the bar-skin linin' of my cabin will testify;&mdash;'sides
      that, I'm the furst manufacturer of whiskey in the range of this district,
      and powerful mixtur' it is, too, as the hull bilin' of fellars in this
      crowd will declar';&mdash;more'n that, I'm a candidate for the
      legislator', and intend to gin up my claim, this term, to the fellar who
      kin talk the pootyest;&mdash;now, finally at the eend, boys, this mixtur'
      of mine will make a fellar talk as iley as goose-grease,&mdash;as sharp as
      lightnin', and as per-suadin' as a young gal at a quiltin', so don't spar
      it while it lasts, and the candidates kin drink furst, 'cause they've got
      to do the talkin'!&rdquo;

    <p>
      Having finished his charge he filled the tin cup full of whiskey, put in a
      handful of brown sugar, and with his forefinger stirred up the sweetening,
      then surveying the canditates he pulled off his cap, remarking, as he did
      so:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old age, allays, afore beauty!&mdash;your daddy furst, in course,&rdquo; then
      holding up the cup he offered a toast, as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is to the string that binds the states; may it never be bit apart by
      political <i>rats!</i>&rdquo; Then holding up the cup to his head he took a
      hearty swig, and passed it to the next oldest looking candidate. While
      they were tasting it, Sugar kept up a fire of lingo at them:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pass it along lively, gentlemen, but don't spar the fluid. You can't help
      tellin' truth arter you've swaller'd enough of my mixtur', jest fur this
      reason, its ben 'stilled in honesty, rectified in truth, and poured out
      with wisdom! Take a leetle drop more,&rdquo; said he to a fastidious candidate,
      whose stomach turned at thought of the way the &ldquo;mixtur&rdquo;' was mixed. &ldquo;Why,
      Mister,&rdquo; said Sugar, coaxingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      'Ef you wur a babby, jest new born,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      'Twould do you good, this juicy corn!' &rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more, I thank you,&rdquo; said the candidate, drawing back from the proffer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sugar winked his eye at some of his cronies, and muttered&mdash;&ldquo;He's got
      an a-ristocracy stomach, and can't go the <i>native licker</i>.&rdquo; Then
      dismissing the candidates he shouted,&mdash;&ldquo;crowd up, constitooents, into
      a circle, and let's begin fair&mdash;your daddy furst, allays; and mind,
      no changin' places in the circle to git the sugar in the bottom of the
      cup. I know you're arter it Tom Williams, but none on your yankeein' round
      to git the sweetnin'&mdash;it's all syrup, fellars, cause <i>Sugar</i>
      made and mixed it. The gals at the frolicks allays git me to pre-par' the
      cordials, 'cause they say I make it mity drinkable. Who next? What you,
      old Ben Dent!&mdash;Well, hold your hoss for a minit, and I'll strengthen
      the tin with a speck more, jest because you can kalkilate the valee of the
      licker, and do it jestiss!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus chatted Sugar as he measured out and sweetened up the contents of his
      kegs, until all who would drink had taken their share, and then the crowd
      assembled around the speakers. We need not say that the virtues of each
      political party were duly set forth to the hearers&mdash;that follows as a
      matter of course, candidates dwell upon the strong points of their
      argument, always. One among them, however, more than his compeers,
      attracted the attention of our friend Sugar, not because he had highly
      commended the contents of his kegs, but because he painted with truth and
      feeling the claims of the western pioneers! Among these he ranked the
      veteran Col. Johnson and his compatriots, and as he rehearsed their
      struggles in defence of their firesides, how they had been trained to war
      by conflict with the ruthless savage, their homes oft desolated, and their
      children murdered,&mdash;yet still, ever foremost in the fight, and last
      to retreat, winning the heritage of these broad valleys for their
      children, against the opposing arm of the red man, though aided by the
      civilized power of mighty Britain, and her serried cohorts of trained
      soldiery! We say as he dwelt upon these themes Sugar's eye would fire up,
      and then, at some touching passage of distress dwelt upon by the speaker,
      tears would course down his rude cheek. When the speaker concluded he
      wiped his eyes with his hard hand, and said to those around him:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That arr true as the yearth!&mdash;thar's suthin' like talk in that
      fellar!&mdash;he's the right breed, and his old daddy has told him about
      them times. So did mine relate 'em to me, how the ony sister I ever had,
      when a babby had her brains dashed out by one of the red skinned devils!
      But didn't we pepper them fur it? Didn't I help the old man, afore he grew
      too weak to hold his shootin' iron, to send a few on 'em off to rub out
      the account? Well, I did!&mdash;Hey!&rdquo; and shutting his teeth together he
      yelled through them the exultation of full vengeance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The speaking being done, candidates and hearers gathered around old Sugar,
      to hear his comments upon the speeches, and to many inquiries of how he
      liked them, the old man answered:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were all pooty good, but that tall fellar they call Tom, from St.
      Louis; you, I mean, stranger,&rdquo; pointing at the same time to the candidate,
      &ldquo;you jest scart up my feelin's to the right pint&mdash;you jest made me
      feel wolfish as when I and old dad war arter the red varmints; and now
      what'll you take? I'm goin' to publicly decline in your favor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pouring out a tin full of the liquor, and stirring it as before, he stood
      upright upon the stump, with a foot on each side of his kegs, and drawing
      off his cap, toasted:&mdash;&ldquo;The memory of the western pioneers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A shout responded to his toast, which echoed far away in the depths of the
      adjoining forest, and seemed to awaken a response from the spirits of
      those departed heroes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the way to sing it out, boys,&rdquo; responded old Sugar, &ldquo;sich a yell
      as that would scar an inimy into ager fits, and make the United States
      Eagle scream 'Hail Columby.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While you're up, Sugar,&rdquo; said one of the crowd, &ldquo;give us a stump speech,
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; shouted an hundred voices, &ldquo;a speech from Sugar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agreed, boys,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;I'll jest gin you a few words to wind
      up with, so keep quiet while your daddy's talkin',
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      'Sum tell it out jest like a song,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      I'll gin it to you sweet and strong.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ony objection ever made to me in this arr county, as a legislatur',
      was made by the wimin, 'cause I war a bachelor, and I never told you afore
      why I re-mained in the state of number one&mdash;no fellar stays single
      pre-meditated; and, in course, a hansum fellar like me, who all the gals
      declar' to be as enticin' as a jay bird, warn't goin' to stay alone, ef he
      could help it. I did see a creatur' once, named Sofy Mason, up the
      Cumberland, nigh onto Nashville, Tennesee, that I tuk an orful hankerin'
      arter, and I sot in to lookin' anxious fur martrimony, and gin to go
      reglar to meetin', and tuk to dressin' tremengeous finified, jest to see
      ef I could win her good opinion. She did git to lookin' at me, and one
      day, cumin' from meetin', she was takin' a look at me a kind of shy, jest
      as a hoss does at suthin' he's scart at, when arter champin' at a distance
      fur awhile, I sidled up to her and blarted out a few words about the
      sarmin'&mdash;she said yes, but cuss me ef I know whether that wur the
      right answer or not, and I'm a thinkin' she didn't know then, nuther!
      Well, we larfed and talked a leetle all the way along to her daddy's, and
      thar I gin her the best bend I had in me, and raised my bran new hat as
      peert and perlite as a minister, lookin' all the time so enticin' that I
      sot the gal tremblin'. Her old daddy had a powerful numerous lot of
      healthy niggers, and lived right adjinin' my place, while on tother side
      lived Jake Simons&mdash;a sneakin', cute varmint, who war wusser than a
      miser fur stinginess, and no sooner did this cussed sarpint see me sidlin'
      up to Sofy, than he went to slickin' up, too, and sot himself to work to
      cut me out. That arr wur a struggle ekill to the battle of Orleans. Furst
      sum new fixup of Jake's would take her eye, and then I'd sport suthin'
      that would outshine him, until Jake at last gin in tryin' to outdress me,
      and sot to thinkin' of suthin' else. Our farms wur jest the same number of
      acres, and we both owned three niggers apiece. Jake knew that Sofy and her
      dad kept a sharp eye out fur the main chance, so he thort he'd clar me out
      by buyin' another nigger; but I jest follor'd suit, and bought one the day
      arter he got his, so he had no advantage thar; he then got a cow, and so
      did I, and jest about then both on our <i>pusses</i> gin out. This put
      Jake to his wits' eend, and I war a wunderin' what in the yearth he would
      try next. We stood so, hip and thigh, fur about two weeks, both on us
      talkin' sweet to Sofy, whenever we could git her alone. I thort I seed
      that Jake, the sneakin' cuss, wur gittin' a mite ahead of me, 'cause his
      tongue wur so iley; howsever, I didn't let on, but kep a top eye on him.
      One Sunday mornin' I wur a leetle mite late to meetin', and when I got
      thar the furst thing I seed war Jake Simons, sittin' close bang up agin
      Sofy, in the same pew with her daddy! I biled a spell with wrath, and then
      tarned sour; I could taste myself! Thar they wur, singin' himes out of the
      same book. Je-e-eminy, fellars, I war so enormous mad that the new silk
      handkercher round my neck lost its color! Arter meetin' out they walked,
      linked arms, a smilin' and lookin' as pleased as a young couple at thar
      furst christenin', and Sofy tarned her 'cold shoulder' at me so orful
      pinted, that I-wilted down, and gin up right straight&mdash;Jake had her,
      thar wur no disputin' it! I headed toward home, with my hands as fur in my
      trowsers pockets as I could push 'em, swarin' all the way that she wur the
      last one would ever git a chance to rile up my feelin's. Passin' by Jake's
      plantation I looked over the fence, and thar stood an explanation of the
      marter, right facin' the road, whar every one passin' could see it&mdash;his
      consarned cow was tied to a stake in the gar din', <i>with a most
      promising calf alongside of her!</i> That calf jest soured my milk, and
      made Sofy think, that a fellar who war allays gittin' ahead like Jake, wur
      a right smart chance for a lively husband!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A shout of laughter here drowned Sugar's voice, and as soon as silence was
      restored he added, in a solemn tone, with one eye shut, and his forefinger
      pointing at his auditory:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is a cussed sight wusser than his gittin' Sofy war the fact, that he
      <i>borrowed that calf the night before from Dick Harkley!</i> Arter the
      varmint got Sofy hitched, he told the joke all over the settlement, and
      the boys never seed me arterwards that they didn't b-a-h at me fur lettin'
      a calf cut me out of a gal's affections. I'd a shot Jake, but I thort it
      war a free coantry, and the gal had a right to her choice without bein'
      made a widder, so I jest sold out and travelled! I've allays thort sence
      then, boys, that wimin wur a good deal like licker, ef you love 'em too
      hard thar sure to throw you some way:

    <h2>
      AN EMIGRANT'S PERILS; OR, A FLYING TICKET ON THE MISSISSIPPI.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he inexperienced
      dweller in a quiet home, who has never been tempted to wander from its
      peaceful precincts, has but a faint idea of the emigrant's troubles, and
      many may fail to deeply sympathise with Michael O'Reily, the subject of
      our sketch; but there are those who have mingled in the perilous tide, and
      can knowingly speak of its dangers. &ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; as Michael would say, &ldquo;it's
      mesilf that has had a full peck measure of thim, barrin' what I
      injayneously iscaped.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Michael's brother, Patrick, had induced him to quit the little cottage and
      <i>pratie patch</i> on the green sod, for a home where &ldquo;goold&rdquo; flowed up
      the rivers. At the time we encountered him he had reached the spot where
      &ldquo;a great man intirely,&rdquo; had prophesied this shiny metal would flow to, and
      he but waited to reach Patrick's home on the Missouri river, to set a net
      in the stream and catch his share. As he and Mrs. O'R., who was well, but,
      naturally enough, &ldquo;wakely,&rdquo; were seated on the boat, considering how they
      could get further up stream, a steamboat runner came to their aid, and
      forthwith made every necessary arrangement for taking them safe. Michael's
      mind being at ease about that matter, he ventured to indulge in a whiff of
      the pipe, when he was accosted by another of the off-in-twenty-minutes
      agents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Passage up the Missouri, sir?&rdquo; inquires the runner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yis, I'm goin' wid ye's,&rdquo; says Michael, &ldquo;sure wan uv your boys <i>ingaged</i>
      me a minnit ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The runner perceiving in a moment that a rival had encountered Michael,
      resolved to do the aforesaid rival out of his passenger, and accordingly
      hurried him off to his own boat, by telling him that <i>steam, was up!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;<i>done</i>&rdquo; runner, on returning and finding his passenger off,
      suspected that the rival boat had secured him, and ventured upon the
      &ldquo;terror experiment&rdquo; to win him back. Michael instantly recognised his
      first friend, and saluted him with&mdash;&ldquo;I'm here, ye see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but you've got yourself into a kingdom-come snarl, if you only
      know'd it, without half tryin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Twist the <i>snarl</i> which way Michael would, it sounded unpleasantly,
      and he ventured to inquire&mdash;&ldquo;Its what did ye say kind of <i>snarl</i>,
      I was in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only just want to open your peepers to the fact, of having been trapped
      on board an old boat, <i>fully insured</i>, with a desperate shaky
      'scape-pipe, and engaged to be blow'd up this trip; so good by old fellow,
      you're ticketed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Och! if she's <i>fully insured</i>, all's right,&rdquo; says Michael,
      whispering safety to his heart, &ldquo;and the boy that I came wid, says she can
      run up a tree if there's a dhrap of wather on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she don't run <i>up</i> a tree,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;she'll be sure to run
      <i>agin</i> a snaggy one, and then, I predicate, some of her passengers
      'll be blow'd tree high, so you're in for it, old hoss! Good by,&mdash;I
      say, if you should see my old uncle <i>down thar</i>,&rdquo; pointing at the
      same time significantly to the rushing river, &ldquo;the one I mean who didn't
      leave me any money, tell him for me, as he's gone to the d&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;l,
      to shake himself&mdash;will you?&rdquo; and after delivering himself of this
      soothing request, he vanished, leaving Michael fancying himself astride of
      a 'scape pipe riding over tree tops, rocket fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Och sorra the day I iver put fut among sich hay-thins!&rdquo; soliloquised
      Michael, &ldquo;to talk of a man's bein' blown to <i>smithereens</i>, as if it
      were but a gintle rap wid a shillaleh&mdash;faith its out uv this I'll be
      immigratin' quicker than you could peel a pratie,&rdquo; and forthwith he
      proceeded to move, with all possible haste, his stock of worldly effects;
      observing which the runner, who had awoke his fears, shouted out as a <i>quickener</i>,
      &ldquo;don't forget uncle, for he would think it dreadful mean, if I didn't send
      word by somebody I knew <i>goin' direct</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave that luggage alone,&rdquo; savagely shouted the mate, &ldquo;you can't leave
      this boat&mdash;you're <i>engaged</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thrue for ye's,&rdquo; says Michael in a doleful tone, &ldquo;be dad I was <i>omadhaun</i>
      enough to do that same, and ye's can blow me up when iver you're a mind
      to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don't blow her up,&rdquo; says the mate, &ldquo;until the downward trip, unless
      some gentleman's requested it in his bargain; if you've got a <i>flying
      ticket</i> we are bound to accommodate you,&rdquo; and just at that moment, <i>whiz</i>
      went a steam-cock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be aisy for the Lord's sake,&rdquo; shouted Michael, &ldquo;blow her up for the
      gintleman comin' down; as I'm not used to it, I might fall awkwardly in
      some man's apple orchard and desthroy a <i>peach</i> tree&mdash;d'ye
      mind.&rdquo; Having been assured that all was safe, and that by express desire
      the blowing up was deferred, he took his seat at the stern. As the shades
      of evening gathered around the boat and over the waters, the steamer
      pushed from her moorings,&mdash;the last we saw of Michael he was holding
      in one hand a small string of beads, with a rosary attached, while the
      other grasped the painter of the jolly-boat towing astern, and his eye
      with a doubtful, but resigned expression, was firmly fixed on the shaky
      'scape-pipe-.

    <h2>
      FUN WITH A &ldquo;BAB.&rdquo; A NIGHT ADVENTURE ON THE MISSOURI.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>t the head of a
      ravine on the border of the river Platte, one bright night in June, was
      gathered a party of Missouri hunters, who were encamped after a day's
      chase for buffalo. The evening's repast was over, and as they stretched
      themselves in easy attitudes around their stack of rifles, each looked at
      the other with a kind of questioning expression, of whether it should be
      <i>sleep</i> or a <i>yarn?</i> The bright moon, with full round face,
      streamed down into their midst, and sprinkled her silvery sheen over shrub
      and flower, investing night in those vast solitudes with a strange charm
      which forbid sleep, and with common consent they raised themselves into a
      sitting posture and proposed a &ldquo;talk,&rdquo; as the red skins say. Dan Elkhorn
      was the leader of the party, and all knew his store of adventure
      inexhaustible, so a unanimous call was made upon Dan for a story. &ldquo;Come,
      Dan,&rdquo; cried a crony, &ldquo;give us something to laugh at, and let us break this
      silence, which seems to breed a spirit of melancholy&mdash;stir us up, old
      fellow, do!&rdquo; Dan pulled his long knife out of his belt, and laying it
      before him, smoothed back his long grey hair. He was a genuine specimen of
      the hardy American mountaineer,&mdash;like the Indian, he dressed in deer
      skins and wore the moccason, while every seam in his iron countenance told
      of 'scapes and peril. Seeing that all were attention he commenced&mdash;&ldquo;Well,
      draw up closer, boys, so I shan't have to holler, 'cause breth is gittin'
      kind a short with me now, and I want to pacel it out to last pretty strong
      till the wind-up hunt. You, Mike, keep your eye skinned for Ingins, 'cause
      ef we git deep in a yarn here, without a top eye open, the cussed varmints
      'll pop on us unawars, and be stickin' some of thur quills in us&mdash;nothin'
      like havin' your eye open and insterments ready. I've a big idea to gin
      you an account of some fun I had with an old <i>bar</i>, on the Missouri,
      when I was a younker, and considerably more spry than I am jest now. I
      want to tell you fust, boys, that bars are knowin' animals, and they kin
      jest tell a younker of the human kind as easily as they kin a small pig
      from the old sow;&mdash;they don't fool with me now, for they've got to <i>know
      me!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, old Alic Dennison, a neighbour of mine on the Missouri, had bin
      about two years up in the mountains, and when he came home he gin a treat
      to all the fellars within thirty miles of him&mdash;that was jest seven
      families&mdash;and among 'em, in course, I got an invite. Alic and I had
      sot our cabins on opposite sides of the drink, near enough to see each
      other, and a red skin, ef he'd come on a scalp visit, would a bin
      diskivered by either. When Alic's frolic was to cum off, I was on hand,
      sartain. About evenin' I got my small dug-out, and fixin' my rifle
      carefully in the fore eend, and stickin' my knife in the edge whar it
      would be handy, I jest paddled over the drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little above our location thar wur a bend in the stream which a kind a
      turned the drift tother eend up, and planted them about the spot between
      our cabins&mdash;. snags and sawyers, jest thar, wur dreadful plenty, and
      it took mity nice padlin' to git across without tiltin'; howsever, I slid
      atween 'em, sarpentine fashion, and got over clar as a pet coon. Thar wur
      considerable folks at Alic's, fur some of the families in them diggins had
      about twenty in number, and the gals among 'em warn't any on your pigeon
      creaturs, that a fellar dassent tech fur fear of spilin' 'em, but raal
      scrougers&mdash;any on 'em over fourteen could lick a <i>bar</i>, easy. My
      decided opinion jest now is, that thur never was a grittyer crowd
      congregated before on that stream, and sich other dancin' and drinkin' and
      eatin' bar steaks, and corn dodger, and huggin' the gals, don't happen bu:
      once in a fellar's lifetime, and scarcely that often.. Old Alic had a
      darter Molly, that war the most enticin', gizzard-ticklin',
      heart-distressin' feline creatur that ever made a fellar git owdacious,
      and I seed Tom Sellers cavortin' round her like a young buffalo&mdash;he
      was puttin' in the biggest kind a licks in the way of courtin', and
      between her eyes and the sweetened whiskey he'd drank, you'd a thought the
      fellar would a bursted. Jest to make matters lively, I headed up alongside
      of Molly, and shyed a few soft things at her, sech as askin' how she liked
      bar steaks cooked, and if Jim Tarrant warn't equal in the elbow to a mad
      <i>panter's</i> tail, when he war fiddlin' that last reel, and sech
      amusin' light conversation. Well, boys, Tom started swellin' instanter. He
      tried to draw her attention from me; but I got talkin' about some new
      improvements I war contemplatin' about my cabin, and the cow I expected up
      from St. Louis, 'sides lonely feelins I'd bin havin' lately, and Tom
      couldn't git in a show of talk, edgeways. Didn't he git mad?&mdash;wur you
      ever near enough to a panter when his har riz with wrath? Well, ef you
      have, you can create some idea of Tom's state of mind, and how
      electricity, from liquor and love, run out to the ends of his head
      kiverin'. It wur easy to see he wur a gittin' dangerous, so I slid off and
      left him alone with the gal. Arter I got a talkin' to another one of the
      settlers' young women, Molly kept lookin' at me, and every now and then
      sayin' somethin' pleasin' across to me, while she warn't payin' any
      attention to Tom at all. He spread himself into a stiff bow and left her;
      then movin' across the floor like a wounded deer, he steadied himself on
      the back of my seat, and lookin' me in the face, says: &ldquo;'Mister Elkhorn, I
      shud be strenuously obleeged to you ef you'll step down thar with me by
      the old per-simmen tree.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I nodded my head, and told him to trot outside and wait till I got the
      docyments, and as soon as he moved I sent his old <i>daddy</i> to
      accompany him. I jest informed the old fellar that Tom wanted a fight, and
      as he was too full of corn juice to cut carefully, I didn't want to take
      advantage of him. The old man said he was obleeged to me, and moved out.
      Tom, thinkin' it wur me, staggered ahead of the old man, and I concluded,
      as it war near mornin', to leave; 'cause I knew when Tom found out his
      daddy was along with him instead of me, he'd have a fight any how. I
      acknowledge the corn, boys, that when I started my track warn't anythin'
      like a <i>bee-line</i>;&mdash;the sweeten'd whiskey had made me powerful
      thick-legged; but arter a fashion I got to my dug-out, with nothin' of
      weapon along in the world but the paddle. Thar war jest enough light to
      tell tha snags wur plenty, and jest enough corn juice inside to make a
      fellar not care a cuss fur 'em. I felt strong as a hoss, too, and the
      dug-out hadn't more'n leaped six lengths from the bank afore&mdash;zip&mdash;chug&mdash;co-souse
      I went&mdash;the front eend jest lifted itself agin a sawyer and emptied
      me into the element! In about a second I came up bang agin a snag, and I
      guess I grabbed it sudden, while old Missouri curl'd and purl'd around me
      as ef she was in a hurry to git to the mouth, so she might muddy the
      Massissippi. I warn't much skeer'd, but still I didn't jest like to hang
      on thar till daylight, and I didn't want to make a fuss fur fear they'd
      say I war skary. I had sot myself on the end of the snag, and was jest
      tryin' to cypher out some way of gittin' to shore, when I thought I
      diskiver'd a fellar sittin' on the bank. At fust, he looked so black in
      the coat I thought it war Tom Sellers, who'd sot himself down to wait fur
      a fight:&mdash;Tom had on at the frolic a black blanket coat with a velvet
      collar, and he thought it particularly nice. Arter lookin' at him move
      about and sit down on his hunkers once or twice, I thought I'd holler to
      him; but he appeared so dreadful drunk that I didn't expect much help from
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tom,' shouted I, 'come out here with a dug-out, and help a fellar off,
      will you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He sot still, without sayin' a word. 'Well,' says I to him, 'you're
      meaner than an Ingin! and would bait a trap with your daddy's leggins.' He
      didn't move fur a spell; at last into the drink he popped, and now,
      thought I, he is mad and no dispute. I could see him paddlin' right fur
      me, and I holler'd to him that I had no insterments, but he didn't say a
      whisper, ony shoved along the faster. At last up he come agin my snag, and
      the next minit he reached fur me, and then he tried to fix his teeth into
      my moccason; so guessin' it war time to do somethin', I jest grabbed fur
      his muzzle, and I'm blessed, boys, ef it warn't a great <i>he bar!</i> The
      cussed varmint had watched me from the house and seed I had no weapons,
      and when I upsot he just counted me his'n, and was quietly calculatin' on
      the bank how he'd best git me out of the water. I had nothin' in the
      yearth but a small fancy pen knife, but I stuck that in him so quick that
      he let me go, and while he swam for one snag I reached for another. I
      never heerd a bar laugh out loud afore, but I'm a sucker ef he didn't
      snigger twice at the way he rolled me off my log.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We sot lookin' at one another fur a spell, when I seed the varmint
      gittin' ready to call on me agin, and in about a second more off he
      dropped, and strait he took a shute for my location. As he came up close
      to me I slit his ear with the small blade, and he got mad; but jest as he
      was circling round me to git a good hold, I dropped on to his hinder eend
      and grabbed his har, and I guess I made, him move fur shore a leetle
      faster than a steam boat&mdash;my little blade kept him dreadful <i>itchy</i>.
      Well, the fun of the thing wur, boys, as soon as the varmint teched shore,
      he turned right round on me, and I'm cussed if I hadn't to turn round,
      too, and scratch for the snag agin! with that consarned bar feelin' my
      legs with his paw every stroke I war makin' to git away from him! I got a
      little skary, now, and a good deal mad, fur thar the varmint war a waitin'
      for me, and whinin' as ef he had been ill-treated, and thar I wur perched
      up on a sawyer, bobbin' up and down in the water. At last I sot a
      hollerin' and kept on at it, and hollered louder, until I seed some one
      cum from the house, and singin' out agin they answered me. I asked who it
      war, and found that it war Molly, old Alic's darter; so I gin her a
      description of my siteaytion, and she war into a dug-out in a minit, and
      paddlin' towards me. I believe I said wonce, boys, that bars wur knowin'
      critters, but ef thar's anythin' true on this yearth, it's the fact, that
      this consarned animal had made up his mind to upsot that gal, and I'm
      blessed ef he didn't jest as cute as ef he'd bin human! Startin' from his
      snag he swam to the dug-out, put up both paws, and over it went&mdash;over
      went Molly into the stream, and off slid Mister bar, laffin' out loud! as
      I'm a white man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I seized Molly as she came floatin' towards me, and stuck her upon my
      sawyer, while I started for an adjinin' snag. I could hear Molly grittin'
      her teeth, she war so bilin' mad, and jest as soon as she could git
      breath, she hollered to me to be sure I never rested till I killed that
      varmint. I swore on that snag that I'd grow thin chasin' the critter, and
      she seemed to git pacified. Well, thar we wur, in the stream, and it a
      leetle too rough to swim in easy, so we had to sing out for help, and I
      yelled till I war nigh onto hoarse, afore anythin' livin' stirred about
      the house; at last, nigger Jake came down to the edge of the river, jest
      as day was breakin', and puttin' his hand over his eyes, he hollers&mdash;&ldquo;'Why,
      Massa Dan, is dat you wot's been hollowin' eber so long for somebody!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'You've jest took the notion to cum see, have you, you lazy nigger&mdash;now
      git a dug-out and come out here and git your missus and me off these
      snags, and do it quick, too, or I'll make you holler!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'What, Missus dar, too!' shouted the nigger, 'well, dat's funny&mdash;de
      Lor!' and off the cussed blueskin started fur the house, and in a few
      minits all that could gethered out to see us and laugh at our water
      locations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had bin gittin' riled by degrees, and now was at a dangerous pint&mdash;the
      steam began to rise off on me till thar wur a small fog above my head, and
      as the half drunken varmints roared a laffin, and cracked their jokes
      about our courtin' in the middle of the drink, I got awful excited. 'I'll
      make ribbons of every man among you,' says I, 'when I git whar thar's a
      chance to fight.' And then the cussed crew roared the louder. Tom Sellers
      yelled out that we'd bin tryin' to <i>elope</i>, and this made Molly mad,&mdash;her
      daddy got a little mad, too, and I bein' already mad, thar wur a wrathy
      trio on us, and the old fellow said, ef he thought I'd been playin' a
      two-faced game, and bitin' his friendship like a pizen varmint, he'd drop
      me off the log I wur on with a ball from his rifle. I jest told him to
      fire away and be d&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;d, for I wur wore out a patience.
      Some of the boys held him, while others got the dug-out and came to our
      assistance. I jest got them to drop me on my side of the river, and to
      send over my rifle, and as soon as it war on hand I onloosed my dog Yelp,
      and started to wipe out my disgrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That infernal bar, as soon as he'd tossed Molly in the stream, started
      for the woods; but, as ef he had reasoned on the chances, the varmint came
      to the conclusion that he couldn't git away, and so got up into a crotch
      of a low tree, about a quarter of a mile from my cabin. Old Yelp smelled
      him, and as soon as I clapped peeper on him I let sliver, when the varmint
      dropped like a log,&mdash;I went to him and found he'd bin dead for an
      nour. My little blade couldn't a killed him, so it's my opinion, clearly
      entertained, that the owdacious varmint, knowin' I'd kill him for his
      trick, jest climbed up thar whar I could easy find him, and died to spite
      me!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His hide, and hard swearin', got me and Molly out of our elopin' scrape,
      and the lickin' I gin Tom Sellers that spring has made us good friends
      ever sence. He don't wonce ventur' to say anythin' about that <i>bar
      scrape</i>, without my permission!&rdquo;

      TELEGRAPHING AN EXPRESS. A NIGHT'S ADVENTURE IN THE AMERICAN BOTTOM.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he great struggles
      to obtain early news in the east, between the proprietors of daily
      journals, has infused a spirit of rivalry in their western brethren, and
      they have been of late, prating all along the Mississippi valley, about
      expresses to Washington, railroads to Oregon, regular lines to California,
      telegraphs connecting St. Louis with the east, &amp;c., and sundry other
      new-fangled methods of getting ahead of time. We do not much wonder at it,
      for this is the age of expresses, and the man who lingers along in the old
      &ldquo;sure-and-easy&rdquo; method, is certain to be lost sight of in the rapid whirl
      of the new order of things. In the matter of news, now-a-days, it is not
      news unless <i>expressed</i>, and we hesitate not to say that the
      President's message, received in the old fashioned wait-till-you-get-it
      manner, would not be read with interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      At St. Louis, on the night of the 17th of December, the <i>President's
      message</i> was expected in town, and many were the suspicious rumours in
      circulation, about private expresses, magnetic telegraphs, and &ldquo;enormous&rdquo;
       arrangements to spread the intelligence with rapidity. Every body knew
      that the old slow-and-easy line through Illinois would be along sometime
      that night, and allowing it ten days from Washington to the Mississippi,
      it was very probable that among its contents' would be found a copy of
      that important document. Col. K., a veteran conducter of the city press,
      called a few of his boys together, that evening, and quietly remarked to
      them:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys, that terrapin team will arrive to night on the other side of the
      river with the message, and as it generally remains there until next
      morning, unless we can persuade the driver to cross the river, we will get
      no message until to morrow, so I wish you to start as an express, and see
      if you can't coax him to cross.&mdash;Use the <i>persuasive</i>,
      liberally, but bring him and the mailbags, <i>anyhow!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orders were positive, and a &ldquo;team&rdquo; of three started to execute the
      Colonel's orders. The river was a sheet of solid ice, upon which the full
      moon poured down a flood of radiance. Across the ice they dashed, gained
      the Illinois side, and chartering a wagon and horses belonging to a couple
      of <i>suckers</i>, started to meet the stage. The drivers of this <i>express</i>
      were dubious about taking their passengers, because they would not
      disclose where they wished to go. &ldquo;Keep dark!&rdquo; said one. &ldquo;Mum is the
      word!&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;They intend to steal sum <i>gal</i> on the road,&rdquo;
       whispered one sucker to his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they've got a cussed poor taste, fur I'll swar thar aint anythin'
      on this yeur road to the bluff' wuth shucks, 'cept Nancy Birch, and her
      temper would tarn the stomic of the d&mdash;&mdash;-l.&rdquo; In the course of a
      few minutes one express passenger remarked to his companion, &ldquo;We'll meet
      the stage this side of the brick house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certain,&rdquo; was his friend's reply. &ldquo;It's out now,&rdquo; said the biggest
      sucker, &ldquo;thar goin' to rob the mail,&rdquo; and he cast a fearful glance over
      his shoulder to see if they had pistols in their hands. The stage was now
      heard lumbering along, and in a few minutes they met, when out dashed the
      <i>expresses</i>. &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; cried one, to the driver&mdash;up mounted
      another to the side of the stage. &ldquo;I'm d&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;d, gentlemen,
      ef we belong to that arr crowd!&rdquo; screamed the sucker driver, &ldquo;I'll jest
      swar on a stack of bibles, that them fellars ony hired our team.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The express who mounted the side of the stage, thinking he might obtain a
      copy from some passenger, thrust his head through the door, and finding
      one &ldquo;insider&rdquo; he demanded:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you got a <i>message?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dake all mit you, mine Got!&rdquo; exclaimed a German passenger in answer, &ldquo;but
      dont gill de fader of dirteen little babys,&rdquo;&mdash;at the same time he
      handed his wallet to the express messenger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the d&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;l with your old leather, give me a <i>message
      paper!</i>&rdquo; shouted the express.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I go to der duyvel, if ish got any oder baper but <i>Indiana!</i>&rdquo;
       exclaimed the Dutchman, still holding forth his wallet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The driver now informed them that he had the message along, but &ldquo;he'd jest
      see them and the city of St. Louis in h&mdash;&mdash;l, afore they'd git
      him two steps further than the law pervided he should go,&rdquo; and that was to
      the Illinois side of the river. He said this so bitter, that the chance
      looked hopeless for moving him, but one of the boys, with a tongue &ldquo;iley
      as a sarpint,' quiet as a mole, and civil as a pill pedlar, climbed up on
      the seat beside him, and placing himself in a good position, he commenced
      whispering close to the ear of the driver, and Eve never yielded as easily
      to the serpent's temptation, as the mail driver now began to melt' under
      the soft whisper floating around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said it would be <i>hot!</i>&rdquo; exclaimed the driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did,&rdquo; replied the whisper, &ldquo;and lots of it, besides a dollar under the
      pitcher of punch, and sundry comfortable fixens around it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't say any more,&rdquo; said the driver, &ldquo;that's jest the kind of <i>snap</i>
      I want to git into to night.&rdquo; So, putting up his horses he shouldered the
      mail bags, and across to St. Louis the party travelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proprietors of the anxious city journals, alarmed at the delay of the
      express, resolved to despatch telegraphs in search of them; and, having
      charged three with the electric fluid, off they started&mdash;and Morse's
      invention aint a beginning to the way the St. Louis specimens travelled.
      Across the ice&mdash;slap&mdash;dash&mdash;up the side of the ferry boat,
      and up the hill. Here were collected about fifty Illinois market wagons,
      and a corresponding number of suckers. A group of these latter were
      gathered around a large fire, discussing the probability of being able to
      cross the ice to St. Louis, on the succeeding day. A telegraph inquired of
      one of these, if he had seen anything of the express. &ldquo;No, I haint,&rdquo; says
      he, &ldquo;but I hev got first rate butter, at two bitts a pound!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Melt your butter!&rdquo; shouted an indignant telegraph. &ldquo;Come and show us the
      road out to Pap's house, captain,&rdquo; said another. The marketeer started a
      few rods with him, and then, as if a sudden thought hit him, looked at the
      telegraph gent, and, pointing his finger at him, he slowly remarked&mdash;&ldquo;No
      you don't hoss! I jest see right through you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you fool, don't you see by my appearance that I am a gentleman?&rdquo;
       inquired telegraph. The sucker marketeer drew off a few paces, to be ready
      to run, and then shouted&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, I've seen jest sich gentleman fellars
      as you in the penitentiary!&rdquo; and off he dashed, congratulating himself on
      his escape from robbery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Away went the telegraphs again, heading for Pap's house, a stopping place
      about one mile from the ferry, and while one led the way, the other two,
      wishing to slip him, hid on the road-side, but the rival telegraph seated
      himself in the road to wait for the appearance of his company. As there
      was no way, in the clear moonlight, to get round him unobserved, they came
      out and again started. Now for it!&mdash;best man at Pap's first! Away
      they started, &ldquo;lickety-click,&rdquo; and arrived at the winning-post within
      touching distance of each other. After rapping up the bar-keeper they
      seated themselves by the stove, leisurely warmed up, and then inquired how
      soon they expected the stage along. &ldquo;<i>It passed here with the message,
      full twenty minutes ago!</i>&rdquo; was the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clear the track!&mdash;hey!&mdash;here was news. Three important aids of
      two printing establishments, two miles from their offices, and the message
      there! Now commenced a stampede unknown to Fashion&mdash;down to the river&mdash;on
      to the ice;&mdash;pit&mdash;pat&mdash;pat&mdash;pit&mdash;slip&mdash;slide&mdash;bang!&mdash;and
      down he goes &ldquo;up, boys, and at it again.&rdquo; The island was reached in
      safety. Here was a dangerous gap, at which stood a foot passenger afraid
      to cross. &ldquo;Look out,&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;you'll get in there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get thunder!&mdash;get out of the road!&rdquo; shouted the foremost&mdash;through
      they dashed&mdash;the last sticking his leg through a feet, and the city
      side was gained like a flash of lightning. The leading telegraph reached
      the composing room of an enterprising city paper, just as the foreman was
      shouting&mdash;<i>proof!</i>

    <h2>
      THE PRE-EMPTION RIGHT; OR, DICK KELSY'S SIGNATURE TO HIS LAND CLAIM.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>ick Kelsy was one
      of the earliest settlers in the Upper Missouri country, and a more
      open-hearted or careless son of Kentucky, never squatted in the &ldquo;Far
      West.&rdquo; He had wandered from his parent state more for a change of location
      than any desire to improve his condition, and if a spot offered easy
      hunting facilities, it mattered not what contingencies were added, Dick
      &ldquo;sot himself down thar.&rdquo; Tall, raw-boned, good-natured and fearless, he
      betrayed no ambition to excel, except in his rifle, and the settlers
      generally conceded that his &ldquo;shooting-iron&rdquo; was particularly <i>certain!</i>
      A spot upon one of the tributaries of the Missouri won Dick's heart at
      first sight&mdash;it bordered upon a beautiful stream;&mdash;had a far
      spreading prairie, skirted by a fine grove of timber, for a landscape, and
      abounded with all sorts of game, from a prairie fowl to an <i>Indian</i>.
      Here Dick built his cabin, beneath the shadow of his own cotton tree, and
      he used to tell his neighbours that nature had, after practising on the
      rest of creation, spread her finishing touches on his claim. Its wild
      beauty deserved his lavish praise.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this western habitation our hero held undisturbed sway, his only
      companion being a negro slave, who was at once his master's attendant and
      friend. Kelsy and the negro had been raised together, and from
      association, although so opposite their positions, had imbibed a lasting
      affection for each other,&mdash;each would have freely shed blood in the
      other's defence. The bonds of servitude were, consequently, moulded into
      links of friendship and affection, securing to them a feeling of
      confidence in their lonely habitation in the wilderness. Their nearest
      neighbours were situated at a small trading settlement, some ten miles
      distant, where Dick always repaired to exchange his furs for ammunition
      and other essentials. Here he also learned the news from the far-off seat
      of government; but the busy world beyond little interested these roving
      sons of the western forests,&mdash;a brush with the <i>red skins</i>, or a
      challenge shooting match, possessed much more interest for them. At
      length, however, these western pioneers were aroused from their quietude
      and inactivity by the news that Congress had passed the famous <i>Pre-emption
      Law</i>. As yet none in the region we write of knew its provisions, or,
      distinctly, what rights it conferred; each squatter, therefore, laid out
      the bounds of his claim in accordance with his own desire, and stood ready
      to defend the title against all encroachments. The fever of emigration
      became an epidemic, and soon that speculating mania, which, in
      imagination, built fortunes in a day, spread even to the confines of
      civilization. The axe of the pioneer soon began to startle the wild
      denizens of the forest, where for ages the hunter alone had disturbed
      their repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      One bright morning a <i>ripple</i> of the advancing tide, in the persons
      of two strangers, was discovered by Dick about a quarter of a mile from
      his cabin, where, apparently, they had rested for the night. The first was
      a man about middle stature, of a dark swarthy complexion, with an uneasy
      eye, prominent teeth, and clad in a dilapidated suit of Kentucky jean;&mdash;an
      old chip hat surmounted his figure, and in his right hand he held the
      sceptre of the pioneer&mdash;a <i>rifle!</i> His companion was a pale,
      sickly-looking little woman, clad in a coarse linsey-woolsey gown, and in
      her hand she held a faded calico sun-bonnet; close by stood a small wagon,
      with a quilt cover, to which was harnessed a horse, bearing evident marks
      of long travel and hard fare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you, strangers?&rdquo; was Dick's first query. &ldquo;Judgin' from
      appearances, you're lookin' out a location.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the man, in a surly tone, &ldquo;I've been lookin' all along, but
      I aint found any yet fit fur a <i>white</i> man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you've jest got to the spot now,&rdquo; says Dick. &ldquo;Creation aint laid
      out any place prettier, and arter takin' a view of it, you'll say so. You
      and the missus better go up to my cabin and rest till you can take a good
      look at its best <i>pints</i>, and I predicate you'll come to a
      conclusion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, guess I'll stay a spell,&rdquo; was the stranger's response, and
      following Dick, he was introduced beneath the Kentuckian's hospitable
      roof, after which Dick started to the settlement for some notions with
      which to entertain them more comfortably. On his arrival the whole
      conversation at the settlement was the <i>pre-emption act</i>, and during
      the debate on its merits, he mentioned the &ldquo;new arrival&rdquo; in his
      neighbourhood, of the strangers. They had passed through the settlement,
      and as all new comers are a subject of interest, various opinions were
      expressed in regard to these.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judgin' from that stranger's frontispiece,&rdquo; said one, &ldquo;I shouldn't like
      him fur a near neighbour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's rayther a sour lookin' customer,&rdquo; added another; &ldquo;and how dreadful
      poorly his wife looks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've invited him to locate near me,&rdquo; remarked Kelsy, &ldquo;and I can't say
      he's got a very pleasin' look; but the rough shell may have a good kernel,
      boys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After providing necessaries, Dick gave the settlers an invitation to come
      up and help the stranger to raise a cabin. All agreed to be thar on the
      next Saturday, and homeward he started. On his arrival, Sam was cooking
      the evening meal of wild game and corn bread, all the time expatiating to
      the guests what a good man &ldquo;Massa Dick&rdquo; was, and particularly impressing
      upon their minds that he, (Sam,) was &ldquo;Massa Dick's 'strordinary niggah!&rdquo;
       Sam's efforts at amusement failed upon the strangers, for one was quietly
      weeping, while the other wore a scowl of anger. Dick noticed their looks
      on entering, and endeavoured to cheer them&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't look down hearted, strangers,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you aint among Ingins ef
      you are near 'em&mdash;thar aint a spot in the universal yearth calkilated
      to make you feel better than whar you are now. Sam and me never felt bad
      sence we located here,&mdash;only when the Ingins penned us in the cabin
      fur three days, while all our bar meat was hangin' on the outside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's this cussed woman,&rdquo; answered the stranger,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;that makes me feel bad&mdash;she's etarnally whimperin' about bein' so
      fur from home&mdash;I wish she was in h&mdash;ll!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop that, stranger,&rdquo; said Dick, in a determined tone; &ldquo;the love I have
      for an old Kentucky mother won't permit me to see or hear one of her sex
      abused beneath my cabin roof, ef it is in the wilderness,&mdash;I don't
      like red skins, none of 'em, but even a <i>squaw</i> couldn't be abused
      here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm done,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;I'll git a cabin of my own, and then I
      guess I'll do as I please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No you won't,&rdquo; said Dick; &ldquo;ef you stay in these diggins and abuse her,
      you're in a hotter place than whar you jest now wished her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It may be supposed that the host and his guest retired, the first night of
      their meeting, with no favourable impression of each other; and while Sam
      and his master were making all right for the night, the former ventured to
      remark&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dar aint much good in <i>dat</i> white man, Massa Dick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a <i>heap</i>, Sam,&rdquo; was his master's reply; &ldquo;but he shan't pisin us
      long with his company;&rdquo; and with this comfortable resolve they turned in
      for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      At daylight Dick started out with his rifle on his arm, to observe the
      foot-prints around his dwelling, and note whether they were biped or
      quadruped, the close proximity of the Indian tribes and their frequent
      thefts, making caution and care necessary to preserve, not only property,
      but life. As he was returning to his cabin a <i>scream</i> startled him
      from his careless gait&mdash;it was a new sound in that wilderness; and
      many a day had passed since Dick heard anything akin to it. He started
      forward with a bound, convulsively clutching his rifle, while his blood
      urged into rapid action by the movement, was again forced back to his
      heart, chilled by another fearful scream of a woman in distress. In a
      moment he emerged from the strip of woods, within view of his cabin, and
      there beheld the stranger with his arm raised to strike; fronting him
      stood Sam, poising a large hunting knife in defence, while upon the other
      arm of the muscular negro, hung the trembling form of the stranger's
      sickly wife. A few moments and Dick was beside the combatants, inquiring
      the cause of their hostile attitude. When Sam informed him that the
      stranger had twice, with his fist, felled the woman to the earth, his
      rifle raised instinctively to his shoulder, as if justice demanded instant
      and dreadful punishment for such a dastard act. Dick slowly remarked, as
      he directed his aim&mdash;&ldquo;I'll sarve you out, you infernal <i>savage!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>

      <a href="images/0341.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      The stricken wife observing the action, threw herself before the weapon,
      imploring the enraged host to spare her husband's life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, woman is woman,&rdquo; soliloquised Dick; &ldquo;for they'll stick to the
      devil, ef they ever take a notion to him. If you have the least hankerin'
      arter the mean varmint, in course I'll let him <i>slide</i>; but he must
      clar out of my diggins&mdash;I can't be near whar anythin' of his breed
      grows,&mdash;so arter breakfast we'll separate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the morning meal was ended, the stranger drew up his wagon, thrust
      his companion into it, and sullenly departed, muttering a threatening
      farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God help that poor creatur,&rdquo; said Dick, as his late guests disappeared
      from view, &ldquo;<i>she's got a hard row to hoe</i>, and as for that sarpent
      with her, he'd better keep out of my tracks. I should be mightily tempted
      to sarch his carcass to see ef he had a heart in it. Sam,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;<i>you're</i>
      a nigger, but thar's more real white man under your black skin than could
      be found in an acre of such varmints as that <i>sucker</i>. Give me your
      fist, old fellar; while Dick Kelsy's got anythin' in this world, you shall
      share it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While this bond of closer friendship was being formed between master and
      slave, malice was holding her revel in the heart of their late guest. He
      had observed Dick's love for the spot where he had squatted, and judging
      rightly that he had neglected to file his claim to it in the Land Office,
      he stopped a short distance below him, intending to remain, and, if
      possible gain possession of it. Kelsy had his dislike for the stranger
      increased by finding him remain on his section, and he ordered him to
      leave forthwith. The stranger gave as an excuse, that his wife was so sick
      that she couldn't travel, and ended with a request that he would let him
      erect a hut to shelter her, while he went in search of a permanent
      location. In pity for <i>her</i>, Dick consented, and the stranger
      proceeded to prepare timber for a small cabin. The following Saturday the
      neighbors gathered, and by nightfall placed a roof over their heads,
      kindly supplied them with some necessaries, and left, each more confirmed
      in his dislike for the stranger. The next morning he started off, as many
      supposed, never to return; the natural kindness of the settlers was
      immediately manifested towards his wife, and nothing that would conduce to
      her comfort, was lacking in the cabin of this heart-broken woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the lapse of several days, contrary to all expectation, the stranger
      returned, and a visible change was manifested in his manner&mdash;his
      surliness assumed a more impudent and offensive character, and on
      receiving a further intimation that it was time he was <i>moving</i>, he
      insolently told Dick to &ldquo;clear out,&rdquo; himself, for that he, (the stranger,)
      was the rightful owner of the claim. Dick laughed at him, and told him to
      be off quietly, that his carcass was safe while that woman clung to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kelsy was laughing next day, down at the settlement, as he related the
      stranger's words, and described his insolent bearing; but his smile of
      scorn was turned to a frown of wrath, when the Land Agent, who happened to
      hear him, informed the unsuspecting squatter, that the stranger had,
      indeed, entered the claim his cabin was upon. Dick, on hearing this news,
      shivered the bottle in his hand to atoms, and drawing his breath through
      his teeth until it fairly whistled, he remarked&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That stranger may have <i>some</i> of my claim, but his share shall be my
      <i>signature to the title</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sun was fast sinking when Dick started home, rather limber from the
      effects of wrath and liquor. Having resigned himself to the care of his
      horse, he swung from side to side, in a state of dozing unconsciousness.
      When he neared his cabin, it had become pitch dark, to which, if possible,
      the woods bordering his claim, added a gloomier shade. The instant his
      horse entered beneath the foliage, a sharp pain shot through the side of
      the rider, so acute as to wake his powers suddenly into full
      consciousness. The spring he made in the saddle startled his horse forward
      into a rapid gait, and in an instant more, a sickly sensation robbed him
      of all consciousness. When he opened his eyes with returning animation,
      his look fell upon his faithful slave, who was bending, with an anxious
      countenance, over the rude couch of his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bress God! Massa Dick, you knows Sam, your ole nigga&mdash;I sees you
      does&mdash;dars life in you yet, massa,&mdash;dar is, but dis poor nigga
      had amost gib you up, for sartain!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An unseen hand had, in the darkness, plunged a knife into Dick's body, as
      he entered the wood; he had clung to his horse's mane, until the animal
      stopped at his cabin door, where Sam, waiting for his master, had caught
      his bleeding and unconscious body in his arms as it fell reeling from the
      saddle. The faithful negro had staunched the blood, and applied every
      restorative his rude knowledge could devise; but it was long ere the eyes
      he so loved opened to the recollection of past events and present injury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was a foul dig in the ribs, Sam,&rdquo; murmured his exhausted master;
      &ldquo;but ef I don't trail up the sarpint and pull his sting out, it'll be
      because I and that ar old rifle of mine has to part company!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The natural strength of the patient, together with Sam's careful nursing,
      soon restored him to his legs, and a few days' gentle exercise imparted
      strength enough to his frame to support the weight of his rifle. A fixed
      resolve to trace the assassin added a severe cast to Dick's pale features&mdash;Sam,
      as he observed him, quietly shook his head, with the remark&mdash;&ldquo;Ah, ah!
      Massa Dick's soon goin' Ingin huntin'&mdash;<i>sure!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One morning, early, Kelsy ordered Sam to saddle his horse, and proceeded
      himself to clean his rifle; with more than usual care he adjusted each
      particular of his accoutrements, and started off to the settlement, taking
      the road leading by his neighbor's cabin. On his arrival, he gathered a
      few of his cronies together, who all knew of the dastardly attempt on his
      life, and imparted to them a scheme he had been maturing, for discovering
      if the stranger was the &ldquo;stabber in the dark,&rdquo;&mdash;which few seemed to
      doubt, but of which he wished to be certain.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the sun inclined to the west, Kelsy made preparation for return, and
      changing his dress for a suit belonging to one of his friends, he stuffed
      his own with straw, surmounted the figure with his fur cap, and mounted it
      upon his horse before him, where it was secured to the saddle; four of his
      friends accompanied him, and thus prepared, they bent their course towards
      Dick's cabin. Night set in while they were on their march, and soon the
      moon rose, casting her soft light over a prairie landscape, as beautiful
      as ever the eye of man rested upon. It was a western scene of wild and
      picturesque loveliness, grand in its vastness of extent, and rich in its
      yet hidden resources. Its lonely quietude was calculated to subdue the
      wild passions which throbbed in the hearts of those who now broke its
      stillness; but a glance at the firm features of the party, proved that its
      beauty was unheeded by them as they swept onward to the dread business of
      their march. When Within a mile of Dick's habitation, they halted in a
      secluded hollow, where they resigned their horses to the care of one of
      the party, with instructions to turn Kelsey's horse loose about the time
      he supposed they, by a circuitous route, on foot, had reached the woods,
      and when he heard a shot, to follow with their other horses. Dick and his
      companions stole unperceived beneath the shadow of the wood, and
      cautiously approached the trail leading to his cabin; ere they had reached
      the spot, however, one of the party descried the horse leisurely wending
      his way across a strip of prairie, the figure seated upon his back swaying
      from side to side, so like his owner when &ldquo;half sprung,&rdquo; that they could
      with difficulty suppress a laugh. The sound of the horse's hoofs brought
      from concealment another figure, whose form was indistinctly visible,
      emerging from behind a thick covert; and the excitement of the moment, at
      thus having securely trapped the offender, had almost discovered them&mdash;their
      game, however, was too intent on his purpose, or he would have heard the
      slight exclamation which burst from the lips of one of the party. Moving
      stealthily to a good position he awaited horse and rider, and taking
      deliberate aim, <i>fired</i>. No movement of the figure indicated a <i>hit</i>,
      and the party could hear his exclamation of disappointment. The horse
      sauntered along undisturbed by the report, perceiving which, the assassin
      hastily reloaded, while Dick and his friends crept up unperceived almost
      to his side. Raising his rifle again, he steadily poised his aim, and
      pulled the trigger&mdash;erect the figure held its place, and resting his
      rifle upon the ground, he exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;I've hit him, or he's the devil
      himself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess its the old gentleman come for you, stranger,&rdquo; said Dick, as he
      snatched the rifle from his hand, and the whole party closed in a circle
      round him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The detected squatter looked paralyzed&mdash;his tongue refused its
      office, while his form, quivering with apprehension, could scarcely keep
      erect, and his usually cold, uneasy eyes seemed fixed balls of light, so
      dreadful were they in their expression of coward fear. The party proposed
      to settle his business at once, and this movement loosened his tongue&mdash;he
      broke forth in piteous accents of supplication&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, God! oh, God!&rdquo;
       cried he, &ldquo;you won't kill me&mdash;will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said one of the party, &ldquo;<i>we won't do anything else!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kelsy interposed, and suggested that his death be deferred until daylight,
      in order that the stranger might see how it was done, and be put to sleep
      respectably. They immediately adjourned to Dick's cabin, where they found
      Sam holding the straw figure in his arms, and looking in a state of stupor
      at the horse; he thought his master was &ldquo;done for;&rdquo; but great was his joy
      when the well-known sounds of Kelsy's voice assured him of his safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      The party seated themselves in a circle in the cabin, with the culprit in
      the centre, and his shrinking form, trembling with fear, and pallid,
      imploring countenance, looked most pitiful. As Kelsy gazed upon him the
      form of his sickly wife seemed to twine her arms around his neck,
      beseeching as when she before interposed herself between him and death,
      and the vision of his mind searched out a tender spot in Dick's heart. He
      resolved to give him a chance of escape, and, therefore, proposed to the
      party that they should decide by a <i>game of cards</i>, whether the
      stranger should die or be permitted to leave the country. Dick's friends
      protested against such mercy; but after an earnest appeal from him, in
      behalf of the woman, they yielded&mdash;cards were produced, and one of
      the party selected to play against the culprit. By Kelsy's entreaty, also,
      he was allowed the choice of his own game, and he selected <i>euchre</i>.
      All seated themselves closer around the players&mdash;breathing seemed
      almost suspended&mdash;a beam of hope lent a slight glow to the pallid
      countenance of the stranger, while the compressed lips and frowning brow
      of his antagonist, gave assurance that no mercy would temper his play for
      this fearful stake. The rest of the party shared his dislike for the
      culprit, who was looked upon as a common foe, and their flashing eyes were
      bent upon his swarthy countenance with an expression of deadly hate, which
      forced out the cold drops of perspiration upon his sickly brow, and sunk
      his heart with fear. The cards were cut, and the stranger won the <i>deal</i>&mdash;he
      breathed with hope&mdash;he dealt and turned up the <i>right bower</i>&mdash;his
      antagonist <i>passed</i>, and the stranger raising the <i>bower</i>, bid
      him play. The hand was soon finished and the stranger counted two! His
      visage lighted up, and he wiped his brow with a feeling of confidence in
      his luck The next hand the stranger ordered the card up and was <i>euchered</i>&mdash;they
      now stood <i>even</i>, and he again looked anxious. In the next two hands
      they successively won, each a single count, and it was the stranger's deal
      again&mdash;he turned up a <i>king</i>, and held in his hand the queen and
      <i>ten of trumps</i>, together with the <i>eight of diamonds and the king
      and ten of clubs</i>. His antagonist ordered the <i>king</i> up, and as
      the stranger discarded his <i>diamond</i>, a gleam of certain success
      overspread his visage&mdash;the rigid face of his antagonist betrayed no
      sign of exultation, but his brow, on the contrary, became closer knit into
      a scowl, which, by his party, was looked upon as a presage of defeat.
      Dick's friend led the <i>jack of clubs</i>&mdash;the stranger followed
      suit with his <i>ten of clubs</i>&mdash;then came the <i>ace of trumps</i>&mdash;the
      stranger paused a moment, and played his <i>ten spot</i>&mdash;out came
      the <i>right bower</i>, and he yielded his <i>queen</i>&mdash;the <i>left</i>
      fell before his eyes, and his last <i>trump</i>, the king, was swept away!
      At each play his countenance grew more and more ashy in its expression of
      despair and dread; his lips had lost their color, and his eyes had gained
      an intenseness of expression that seemed as if they could look into the
      very soul of the frowning figure before him, and read there his impending
      doom. For the first time a slight smile played upon the features of Dick's
      friend as slowly he spread before him the <i>ace of clubs!</i> The
      stranger crushed his <i>King</i> within his trembling hands and threw it
      from him, as he sunk into a state of stupor, the very counterpart of
      death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your game's up, stranger,&rdquo; coolly remarked the winner; &ldquo;yes, it's up&mdash;played
      very neat&mdash;but it's up! And you've jest won a small patch of Kelsy's
      claim&mdash;about six foot by two, or thereabouts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sun had begun to tip the tops of the forest trees, when this exciting
      contest was ended, and all the party adjourned to the outside, with the
      doomed stranger in their midst. They moved with silence, for a deed of
      blood was to be enacted. The law of the wilderness was about to offer up a
      victim for common safety&mdash;the midnight assassin to expiate his guilt
      upon the spot, and by the hand of him whom he had there endeavored to
      consign to death.&mdash;The music of the morning songsters met no
      harmonious accord in the hearts of those who now strode amid their
      melodies&mdash;the sweet morning air kissed brows fevered with passion,
      and the light breeze that played amid the forest grove and skipped
      innocently across the far spread prairie, was about to bear upon its
      pinions the shriek of agony. Having arrived at a suitable spot, they bound
      the culprit to a sapling, and he hung in his bonds already, apparently,
      bereft of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stick him up at a hundred yards, boys,&rdquo; said Dick; &ldquo;ef he is a <i>snake</i>,
      give him a 'small show' for life, and ef I miss him at the first fire
      we'll let him <i>slip</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The culprit aroused on hearing this, and plead for the smallest chance in
      the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't shoot me like a <i>mad dog!</i>&rdquo; he exclaimed, in most piteous
      accents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're worse, you hound,&rdquo; said his late antagonist; &ldquo;and if Dick don't
      wind up your business for you, <i>I</i> will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, boys,&rdquo; continued Dick, &ldquo;you all know that this old iron's <i>certain</i>,
      so give the varmint this chance&mdash;it'll please him, and he'll die off
      all the easier!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After some persuasion, Dick's request was acceded to, and the parties took
      their positions. Life hung, for the culprit, by but a thread, and that
      thread the will of Kelsy. Slowly the latter raised his rifle, while the
      party, breathless, intently fixed their eyes upon the victim. Dick's hand
      began to tremble, and his aim became unsteady, for the sickly form of the
      stranger's wife again seemed to rise and plead for mercy&mdash;he rested
      his rifle on the ground, without the heart to fire; but, in an instant the
      vision fled, and his eye fell clear upon the countenance of the stranger;
      a morning ray lighting up his features, exhibited a gleam of mingled
      triumph, hatred, hope, and revenge&mdash;there was no mistaking its dark
      expression of contending passions. The pity that had almost unnerved Kelsy
      and saved his foe, vanished, and raising his rifle sudden as thought, the
      weapon rung out the stranger's knell. As the ball from its muzzle sped
      through his brain, a wild shriek arose upon the air, and all was again
      still&mdash;they loosened his bonds, and he fell forward, <i>dead!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      His remains were consigned to the earth without a tear, even from his
      companion, to whom the tragedy-had been imparted. His cruelties had long
      since obliterated from her heart the last spark of early fondness; all she
      requested, when the grave had closed over him, was to be sent to her
      friends in Ohio, which was kindly done by the settlers&mdash;Dick
      bestowing upon her his whole stock of fine furs to defray her expenses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kelsy set himself down in undisturbed possession of his claim, and Sam,
      his faithful slave, often points to the small green mound at the edge of
      the grove, with the remark&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dat's Massa Dick's signature to dis land claim&mdash;<i>dat is!</i>&rdquo;

    <h2>
      YALLEK PLEDGES; OR, THE FIGHT ABOUT SALLY SPILLMAN.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t aint natral fur
      a fellar to tell of his gittin' licked, but I must tell you about that
      thar fight between me and Jess Stout&mdash;it war a screamer, by thunder!
      and ef I did gin in, it warn't in the course of human natur' to do any how
      else. That gal <i>spontenaceously</i> hankered arter Jess, and besides,
      he'd piled up the affection in her, by an amazin' long spell of courtin'.
      I did kinder edge into her likin', and gin to speckelate big on throwin'
      Jess, but that fight knocked my calculations all to fritters. I'm some in
      a bar fight, and considerable among panters, but I warn't no whar in that
      fight with Jess. In course, I'll tell you, boys, so sot yourselves round,
      and pass along that corn juice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, every time I come up from Lusiane, I found Jess hangin' round
      that gal, Sally Spillman, lookin' orful sweet, and a fellar couldn't go
      near her without risin' his dander&mdash;he was jealous as a hen with
      young chickens. I sot my eyes on her, to find out what Jess saw in her so
      amazin' inticin', and I swar ef a close examination didn't make me yearn
      arter her like a weaned yearling. She was all sorts of a gal&mdash;thar
      warn't a sprinklin' too much of her&mdash;she stuck out all over jest far
      enough without cushinin'&mdash;had an eye that would make a fellar's heart
      try to get out of his bosom, and then sich har;&mdash;her step was as
      light as a panter's, and her breath sweet as a prairie flower. In my
      opinion, the mother of all human natur' warn't an atom slicker model; she
      desarved the pick of a whole creation, and I jest felt that I was made a
      purpose for her!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At all the frolicks round the country, down in the Missouri bottom, or up
      the Osage, Jess was hangin' arter that gal, lookin' honey at her, and
      pizin at the fellars who spoke pleasin' to her. I thort I'd try my hand at
      makin' him oneasy, so one night, at a frolick, I sidled up to her and axed
      how she wur, and ef that ailin' nigger of her daddy's wur improvin', what
      'ud be the probable amount of the old man's tobaccer crop this season, and
      some other interestin' matters of talk. She said that she was thrivin', as
      usual, the nigger wur comin' on as well as could be expected, and the old
      man's crop promised to be purty considerable. Nothin' could be more
      satisfying so I kept on a talkin', and she got a laffin', and Jess begun a
      scowlin'. I seed he warn't pleased, but I didn't estimate him very tall,
      so I kept on, got a dancin' with Sally, and ended by kissin' her good by,
      that night, and makin' Jess jealous as a pet pinter!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wur agoin to start to Lusiane next day, with a flat load of tobaccer
      and other groceries, and afore I went, I thort I'd send a present of my
      pet 'bar cub' over to Sally, jest to have a sorter hitch on her till I'd
      git back; so I gits my nigger Jim and gins him the followin' note, with
      the bar cub, and special directions that he wur to give 'em both to Sally,
      herself:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;'Panter Crik, near Bar Diggins,

     Juin twenty 4.

     &ldquo;'To the captivatin' Miss Sally Spillman:

     &ldquo;'Your tender adorer, Sam Crowder, sends you the followin'
     fust trofy of a hunt on the Osage; the condition of this bar
     are somethin' like him, the bar are all fat, he are all
     tenderness! Hopin' that you will gin up a small corner of
     your heart to the writer, while he is among the furriners of
     Lusiane, he will ever remember you, and be sure not to
     furgit to bring a pledge of affection from the sunny south,
     to bind our openin' loves.

     &ldquo;'Yours, with stream, or agin it.

     &ldquo;'Sam Crowder.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I studdyed that out with considerable difficulty, and writ it with more,
      and 'stick me on a sand-bar' ef that Jess didn't way-lay Jim and read the
      note! Maybe it didn't stir up the alluvial bottom of his love fur Sally&mdash;the
      varmint's countenance looked as riled as the old Missouri in a June rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Off I started next day, with my flat, for the imporium of the south, and
      as I war floating along, I couldn't help turnin' over in my mind what a
      scrougin smart family the Crowders would be, when Sally and I agreed upon
      annexation. I jest thort I could see 'young Sam,' the fust boy, standin'
      on the other eend of the flat, strong as a bar&mdash;eye like an Ingin&mdash;spry
      as a catamount&mdash;fair as Sally and keen as his daddy&mdash;I swar, I
      yelled rite out, thinkin' on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While I was in this way rollin' in clover, by pic-turin' what was to be,
      they wur tarin' my character all to <i>chitlins</i> up at home. My perlite
      note was raisin' a parfect freshet of wrath agin me. That display of
      larnin', about bringin' home a <i>pledge of affection</i>, from the sunny
      south, most onaccountably oversot my whole family prospects. It wur a
      stumper to Sally, so she got Jess to explain it, and the way he did it was
      <i>enormous</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Why, don't you see,' ses Jess, 'he means to bring you up one of his
      nigger children, from the south, to <i>nuss!</i> Nothing can be plainer&mdash;thar
      aint no other 'pledges of affection' than children, that I know on.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I swar ef she didn't believe him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'The nasty dog,' ses Sally, 'does he think I'm agoin to nuss any of his
      yaller pledges&mdash;ef them thar is all he's got to offer, he aint wuth
      shucks, and ef you don't lick him fur his onmannerly note, you aint wuth
      shucks, nuther.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not dreamin' of the row at home, I was a huntin' through Noo Orlins fur
      presents fur Sally. I bought a roll of ribbon, a pocket full of lace, and
      a bran new, shinin' silk parasol, and was comin' along, slow and easy, by
      the St. Louis Exchange, when I heerd Major Beard cryin' off a lot of field
      hands. I jest sauntered in as he was puttin' up a picanninny 'yaller gal,'
      about five years old. The little gal had no mammy livin', and looked
      sorter sickly, so nobody seemed anxious to git her. I hollered fifty
      dollars, and the little creatur' brightened up when she seed who was a
      biddin'; I didn't look like a sugar or cotton planter, and the creatur'
      seemed glad that I warn't. Some cotton fellar here bid sixty dollars, and
      she wilted rite down&mdash;I thort what a slick present she'd be fur
      Sally, and how well she'd do to tend the children, so I sung out seventy
      dollars; she knew my voice, and I could see her eyelids trimble. No sooner
      did the Major drop the hammer on seventy dollars, than she looked wuth a
      hundred, she was so pleased at my buyin' her. She was a nice little
      creatur', but her <i>har</i> was oncommon straight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I started up home next day, with my purchases, and sich a time as I had
      on the way. I got dreamin' so strong about bein' married to Sally, that I
      was etarnally wakin' up huggin' and kissin' the pillows, as ef they wur
      gals at a huskin'. At last I got home, tickled all to death at my future
      prospects. I met Jess at the landin'&mdash;he gin me a starr, looked at
      the little yaller gal, and then spread himself with a guffaw, as ef he wur
      goin' into fits. I riled up a little, but thought thar wur time enough to
      sarve him out, so I passed on. The fellars in the settlement seemed to be
      allfired pleased at my gittin' back, fur they kept a grinnin' and bowin'
      and lookin' at my little yaller gal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Wont you take a little suthin', Sam,' said Jim Belt, the grocery keeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Not now, I thank you, Jim, ses I.' &ldquo;'What, you aint agoin' in fur
      temperance <i>pledges</i>, too, are you?' asked Jim, and then the boys all
      holler'd as ef they'd bust thar heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Not ex-a-c-t-ly!' ses I, rather slow, tryin' all the time to find out
      what the fun war, but I couldn't get it through my kiverin' of <i>har</i>,
      so I gin it up and went home. Next day thar wur to be a campmeetin' down
      in the bottom, and all the boys and gals wur agoin' to it; so, to make a
      shine with Sally, I sent over word that I would call that mornin' and
      bring with me my fust <i>pledge of affection</i>, meanin' the parasol, and
      hoped it would be to her mind both in <i>textur</i> and color. Back came
      this note in anser:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;'Kune Holler, Juli 8.

     &ldquo;'Miss Spillman's compliments &ldquo;'To Sam Crowder, Esq.; the
     fust pledge of his affections is a little too yaller, and
     the textur of its har is too tight a curl, and, more'n that,
     she aint ambitious to hev any of his pledges ef tha wur all
     white.

     &ldquo;'Sally Spillman.'
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I nigh onto bust with madness!&mdash;I could feel every har on my head
      kindlin' at the eend, 'cause I knew sum cussed lie had been told her, and
      I blamed Jess fur doin' it. I jest swar a bible oath, I'd spile his
      pictur' so he couldn't enjoy campmeetin' much; so next mornin,' bright and
      airly, I <i>accidentally</i> fell in with Jess, goin' arter Sally, with
      all his Sunday kiverin' on, lookin' as nice as a 'stall fed two year old.'
      I rite up and asked him what he meant by tellin' lies to the galls about
      me; that I'd hearn on 'em all over the settlement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I haint told no lie on you,' ses Jess, 'fur what's told, you told
      yourself&mdash;ef you hev <i>nigger babies</i> in the south, you needn't
      insult decent white gals by offerin' to let 'em <i>nuss</i> 'em&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't wait till he finished afore I hit him, <i>biff</i>, alongside of
      his smeller, and went into him <i>all-fours</i>, catamount fashion. The
      thing had now cum to a windin' up pint&mdash;this fight war to eend the
      matter about Sally, and as I didn't want to gin her up easy, I laid myself
      out fur a purty long spell. I could soon see by the way Jess went to work
      that he'd kalculated upon a pretty big <i>chunk</i> of a fight, too, so we
      both began to save ourselves. I had a leetle the advantage of Jess, for he
      didn't want to spile his Sunday fix-ups, while I didn't care a cuss fur my
      old boat suit. When I'd grab his trowsers and gin 'em a hitch, he'd ease
      off, and then I'd lend him a staggerer, which was generally follered by
      his makin' me fly round like a weazel&mdash;cre-a-tion, how tough he war!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While we wur havin' a rite smart time together, nary one of us seed Sally
      ridin' along down the wagin track, lookin' out fur Jess, but she seed us,
      hitched her horse, and climbed onto a stump to see the fight out. As I war
      carfully reachin' fur Jess' ear with my grinders, I heerd her sing out&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tech it ef you <i>dar!</i>&mdash;you nigger cannibal!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her hollerin' gin Jess an advantage and helped his strength powerfully,
      fur the next minit I war on my back and him right astraddle on me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'<i>Sock</i> your teeth into him, Jess!' screamed Sally, and about then,
      <i>je-e-e-miny</i> fellars, I leaped as ef lightnin' had hit me, fur his
      grinders had met through the flesh she called his attention to. I
      squirmed, and struggled, and chawed meat, but he held on&mdash;I grabbed
      his new trowsers, and tore them like paper&mdash;he was agoin to let go to
      kiver his coat tails over the torn place, but Sally hollered out agin&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Whip the varmint fust and then I'll mend 'em up!'&rdquo; I squealed enough!
      rite out&mdash;it warn't no use a fightin' agin such odds. Arter Jess let
      me up, Sally looked at me, and puckered up her mouth as ef she had been
      eatin' unripe persimmons&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'<i>Enough!</i>' ses she, 'well, may I git ager fits, ef you're fit fur
      anythin' but to be the father of <i>yaller pledges!</i>&rdquo;

    <h2>
      GEORGE MUNDAY, THE HATLESS PROPHET.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>his odd character
      has lately favored the west with a visit, and during two successive
      evenings he edified audiences, numbering about a thousand persons, in the
      rotunda of the St. Louis court-house. Some took him for the <i>Wandering
      Jew</i>, and as he inveighed against the evils of these modern days, they
      looked at him with a feeling of awe. One day opposite the Planter's house,
      during a military parade, George was engaged selling his edition of the
      &ldquo;Advocate of Truth,&rdquo; when a tall hoosier, who had been gazing at him with
      astonishment for some time, roared out in an immoderate fit of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you see so funny in me, to laugh at?&rdquo; inquired George.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, hoss,&rdquo; said the hoosier, &ldquo;I wur jest a thinkin' ef I'd seed you out
      in the woods, with all that har on, they would a been the d&mdash;dest
      runnin' done by this coon ever seen in them diggins&mdash;you're ekill to
      the <i>elephant!</i> and a leetle the <i>har</i>-yest small man I've seen
      <i>scart</i> up lately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sight at George, on his western tour, has brought to my recollection an
      anecdote, which entitles him to a place in our collection of odd
      characters;&mdash;it occurred several years since, in Philadelphia, and
      the writer was an eye witness of the occurrence.
    </p>
    <p>
      George's favorite neighborhood for &ldquo;holding forth,&rdquo; was in and about the
      famous old &ldquo;State House,&rdquo; where, bare-headed&mdash;with unshorn beard, and
      adorned with a simple wooden cross, he, in a few moments, would collect a
      crowd. At length the police arrested him, for obstructing the passage, and
      George was sent to the Alms-House. In a few days, he escaped from the
      institution, and, boiling with indignation, hastened back to his old
      haunt, to lay his grievances before the people. Having provided himself
      with a couple of gimlets, he entered the building, raised the large window
      above the back entrance, and, placing himself on the old-fashioned
      entablature over the door-way, (the same spot where the Declaration of
      Independence was read from,) he shut down the window behind him, securing
      himself from interruption by boring his gimlets through the sash, into the
      frame. Then, with much solemnity, he proceeded to paraphrase the
      &ldquo;Declaration,&rdquo; applying it to his own particular case. The scene was truly
      ludicrous. Below, was one of the high constables and an assistant
      policeman, together with a numerous crowd of curious hearers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When, in the course of human events&rdquo;&mdash;began George.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you come down from there?&rdquo; demanded the constable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A long train of abuses and takings up without authority,&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aint you a comin'; now?&mdash;if you don't I'll bring you,&rdquo; threatened
      authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our mayor, like the kings of old, set upon us swarms of corrupt and
      drunken officers to put the prophets of truth into pestilential abodes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, do, George, stop your lingo&mdash;that's a good fellow,&rdquo; said the
      officer, coaxingly, seeing that the usual means of reaching the offender
      were cut off; &ldquo;and come down without bother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look up!&rdquo; shouted the indignant advocate of truth, &ldquo;lookup, you
      stiff-necked, corrupt son of Belial!&mdash;you dog in office!&mdash;you,
      that belch forth the corrupt effluvium of liquid death, commonly styled
      rum!&mdash;you are the chief of a band of authorised knaves, composed of
      evil expounders of the law, otherwise called pettifoggers, and certain
      other rogues in office, who are styled 'the police.'&mdash;You lead
      captive the senses of the mayor, who is as much bridled by your wickedness
      as the beast of the same name!&mdash;you cause him by your false tongues
      to do evil, but, there is a day coming&mdash;there is! when, at a bar
      where your credit has long since been chalked out, I'll make an ajffidavy
      will knock you so far into the regions of darkness, that the final trump
      will sound like a penny whistle to your ear!&mdash;do you hear that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The policeman did hear that, but his amiability could stand it no longer;
      so, procuring a watchman's ladder, he commenced climbing to the prophet,
      who coolly unscrewed his gimblets, hoisted the window, lifted up his
      robes, and, shouting &ldquo;woe to the wicked,&rdquo; beat a successful retreat.

    <h2>
      COURTING IN FRENCH HOLLOW.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>ourtin' is all
      slick enough when every body's agreed, and the gal aint got no mischief in
      her, but when an extensive family, old maids, cross daddy, and a romantic
      old mommy, all want to put thur fingers into the young uns dish of sweet
      doin's, and the gal's fractious besides, why a fellar that's yearnin'
      arter matrimony is mity likely to git his fires dampened, or bust his
      biler.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus reasoned Tom Bent to a select party of river cronies, who were seated
      around him upon the boiler deck of a Mississippi steamer, as she sped
      along one bright night in June, somewhere in the neighborhood of Bayou
      Teche. The subject was courting, and on that particular question Tom was
      considered an oracle, for, besides having a strong penchant for the fair
      sex, he had run many risks to ingratiate himself in their affections. Tom
      was now fast falling into the sear and yellow leaf of bachelorism, and
      although he had vowed unalterable affection to at least one fair one in
      each town between the mouth and the rapids, he still remained in unblessed
      singleness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about that afarr of your'n with old Fecho's gal, in St. Louis, Tom?&rdquo;
       inquired one of the circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, that little French gal?&rdquo; inquired Tom, with a grin; &ldquo;well, that
      thar was a salty scrape, boys, and though the laugh is agin me thar, I'm
      blessed if I don't gin you the sarcumstince.&rdquo; So Tom squared himself for a
      yarn, wet his lips with a little corn juice, took a small strip of
      Missouri weed, and &ldquo;let out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That gal of old Fecho's wur about the pootyest creatur, fur a foreigner,
      I ever took a <i>shute</i> arter; her eyes jest floated about in her head
      like a star's shadow on a Massissippi wave, and her model was as trim as
      the steamer Eagle, 'sides, her paddles wur the cleanest shaped fixins that
      ever propelled anythin' human, and her laugh rung like a challenge bell on
      a 'fast trip'&mdash;it couldn't be beat. She run into my affecshuns, and I
      couldn't help it. I danced with her at some on the balls in Frenchtown,
      and thar I gin to edge up and talk tender at her, but she ony laughed at
      my sweet'nin'. Arter a spell, when I cum it strong about affecshun, and
      the needcessity of towin' side and side together, she told me that her old
      daddy wouldn't let her marry an American! Ef I warn't snagged at this, I
      wouldn't say so. The old fellar wur a sittin' on a bench smokin' and
      lookin' on at the dance, and I jest wished him a hot berth for a short
      spell. 'Well, Marie,' said I, c ef I melt the old man down will you gin
      in?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Oh,' says she, 'you so vair strong at de vat you call <i>coax</i>, I
      shall not know how to say von leetel no.' So havin' fixed it all with her
      smooth as a full freight and a June rise, I drew up alongside of the old
      fellar, jest as he had cleared his chimley for a fresh draw of his pipe.
      Old Fecho had been a mountain trader, was strong timbered, not much the
      worse fur wear, and looked wicked as a tree'd bear. I fired up and
      generated an inch or two more steam, and then blew off at him. 'That's an
      onconscionable slick gal of your'n, Mounseer,' says I, to begin with, and
      it did tickle his fancy to have her cracked up, 'cause he thought her
      creation's finishin' touch,&mdash;so did I! 'Oui, sair,' says old Fecho,
      'she vair fine leetel gal, von angel wizout de ving, she is, sair, mine
      only von <i>fille</i>.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Well, she is a <i>scrouger</i>,' answered I, 'a parfect high pressure,
      and no dispute!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Vat you mean by him, eh? vat you call s-c-r-r-r-ouge, eh? vat is he,
      sair, my leetel gal no vat you call von s-c-r-r-r-ouge, sair!' and here
      old Fecho went off into a mad fit, jest as ef I'd called her bad names. I
      tried to put down his 'safety valve,' but he would blow off his wrath, and
      workin' himself into a parfect freshet of rage, he swore he would take the
      little gal off home; and I'm blessed ef he didn't. As soon as I eyed the
      old fellar startin' I got in his wake and follered him, detarmined to find
      out whar he located, and arter an eternal long windin' through one street
      arter another, down he dived into French Hollow. Jest as he wur about to
      enter a house built agin the side of the hill, the old fellar heered my
      footsteps, and turnin' round in the darkness, he shouted&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Ah, ha! von sneak Yankee doodel, vat call my leetel gall von
      s-c-r-r-r-ouger, I shall cut you all up into von leetel piece vidout von
      whole.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, boys, I aint easy skeer'd, but I own up that old fellar did
      kind a make me skeery; they told sich stories about the way he used to
      skin Ingins, that I gin to think it was about best to let him have both
      sides of the channel ef he wanted it, so I didn't darr go to see Marie fur
      a long spell. One day I felt a strong hankerin', and jest strolled along
      the holler to git a glimpse on her, and sure enough thar she wur, a
      leanin' out the winder, smilin' like the mornin' sun on a sleepin' bayou.
      I sidled up to the house, and asked her ef I darr cum and sit up with her
      that evenin'. I told her I was jest fritterin' away all to nothin'
      thinkin' on her, and a small mite of courtin' would spur me up amazin',
      and then I gin her sich a look, that she fluttered into consent as easy as
      a mockin' bird whistles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Oh, oui, you shall come sometime dis night, when <i>mon pere</i> is gone
      to de <i>cabaret</i>; but you must be vair quiet as von leetel rat, vat
      dey call de mouse, and go vay before he come back to de <i>maison</i>.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In course I promised to do jest as she said. I kissed my hand to her, and
      said <i>aur ravoir</i>, as the French say for good by, and then paddled
      off to wait for night. I felt wuss than oneasy until the time arriv, and
      when it did git round I gin to crawl all over&mdash;I swar I was a leetle
      skeered. Hows'ever, it warn't manly to back out now when the gal was
      expectin' me, so I started for the Hollow. I think a darker night was
      never mixed up and spread over this yearth&mdash;you remember, Bill, the
      night you steered the old Eagle square into the bank at Milliken's bend?
      well, it wur jest a mite darker than that! A muddy run winds along through
      the ravine whar the house stands, and I wur particularly near flop-pin'
      into it several times. A piece of candle in the winder lighted me to whar
      the little gall was a waitin', and when I tapped at the door below, she
      pattered down and piloted me up to the sittin' room, whar we sot down and
      took a good look at each other. She looked pooty enough to tempt a fellar
      to bite a piece out on her. I had all sorts of good things made up to say
      when a chance offered, and here the chance wur, but cuss me ef I could get
      out the fust mutter. Whether it wur skeer at the idee of the old
      Frenchman, or a bilin' up of affecshun fur his darter that stuck my throat
      so tight, I'm unable to swar, but thar I wur, like a boat fast on a
      sand-bar, blowin' some, but makin' mity little headway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Vat is de mattair wiz you, Mounseer?' said Marie, 'you look vair much
      like de leaf in von grand storm, all ovair wiz de shake!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Well,' says I, 'I do feel as ef I wur about to collapse a flue, or bust
      my biler, for the fact of the marter is, Marie, they say your old daddy's
      a tiger, and ef I git caught here thar'll be suthin' broke&mdash;a buryin'
      instead of a weddin';&mdash;not that I'm the least mite skeered fur
      myself, but the old man might git hurt, and I should be fretted to do any
      sech a thing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Oh, mon amie, nevair be fear fur him, he is von great, strong as vat you
      call de gentleman cow?&mdash;von bull,&mdash;but, mon Dieu! what shall I
      do wiz you, suppose he come, eh? He vill cut you into bits all ovair!'
      &ldquo;'But, my angel,' ses I, 'he shant ketch me, fur I'll streak it like a
      fast boat, the moment I hear steam from his scape-pipe&mdash;the old man
      might as well try to catch a Massissippi <i>catty</i> with a thread line,
      as git his fingers on me.' I had no sooner said so, than <i>bang!</i> went
      the door below, and old Fecho, juicy as a melon, came feelin' his way up
      stairs, mutterin' like a small piece of fat thunder, and swarin' in
      French, orfully. I know'd thar warn't much time to spare, so I histed the
      winder and backed out. Jest as I was about to drop, Marie says to me&mdash;'Oh,
      mon Dieu! don't drop into de <i>vell!</i>' and instanter shut the winder.
      My har riz on eend in a moment&mdash;'<i>don't drop into the well!</i>'
      I'll tell you what, boys, a souse into the Massissippi in ice time warn't
      half as cold as her last warnin' made me. It was so etarnal dark that I
      couldn't begin to tell which side of the buildin' I wur on, and that wur
      an all important perticuler, fur it wur jest <i>three</i> stories high on
      one side, towards the Hollow, and it warn't only <i>one</i> on the side
      next the hill&mdash;in course, all the chances wur in favor of the <i>well</i>
      bein' on the low side. I'd gin all I had then to know which side was
      waitin' below fur me. I looked up, as I hung on, to see ef thar warn't a
      star shinin' somewhare, jest to give a hint of what was below, but they'd
      all put on thar night caps, and wouldn't be coaxed from under the kiver;
      then I'd look below, and listen, until I made sartin in my mind that I
      could hear the droppin' of water, somewhare about <i>fifty feet</i> below
      me! Old Fecho was a tearin' through the room, and a rippin' out French
      oaths, in an oncommon rapid manner, and declarin' that he knew some one
      had bin thar, fur he'd bin told so. Two or three times he appeared to be a
      rushin' for the winder, and the little gal would coax him back agin, and
      then he'd cuss de Yankee doodels, and grit his teeth most owdaciously.
      Well, ef I warn't in an oneasy situation all this time, then I'm more than
      human&mdash;my arms jest stretched out to about a yard and a half in
      length, and gin to cramp and git orful weak. I couldn't fur the life of me
      think on any prayer I'd ever heerd&mdash;at last, jest as one hand was
      givin' way its hold, I thort of a short one I used to say when I was a
      younker, and mutterin'&mdash;'Here I drop me down deep, I pray the Lord my
      bones to keep!' I sot my teeth together, drew a long breath, shut my eyes,
      and let go!&mdash;whiz!&mdash;r-r-r-ip!&mdash;bang! I went&mdash;as I
      supposed&mdash;about fifty feet; and didn't I holler, when I lit and
      rolled over, and the water soused all round me! 'Murder! oh, git me out,
      oh-o-o-o, murder! The people came a rushin' out of their houses, with
      lights, and sich another jargon of questions as they showered at me&mdash;askin',
      all together, who'd bin a stabbin' me? what wur the marter? and who'd hit
      me? I opened my eyes to tell 'em I'd fell from the third story, and broke
      every bone in my body, when, on lookin' up, thar wur the old Frenchman and
      his darter, grinnin' out of the top winder, about <i>ten feet</i> above
      me! The fact wur, boys, I'd dropped out on the <i>hill side</i> of the
      house, and jumped down jest <i>four feet</i> from whar my toes reached,&mdash;I
      had lit on the edge of a water pail, and it flowed about me when I fell
      over! Arter old Fecho told them the joke, they pretty nigh busted a
      larfin' at me. I crawled off, arter firin' a volly at old Mounseer, of the
      hardest kind of cusses, and from that day to this I han't gone a courtin'
      in French Hollow!

    <h2>
      THE SECOND ADVENT! TOM BANGALL, THE ENGINEER, AND MILLERISM.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>bout the period
      fixed upon by Father Miller, for the general blowing up of the world, some
      of the engineers upon our western waters, who had been used to blowing up
      its inhabitants, became a little frightened at the prospect of having to
      encounter, in another world, the victims of steamboat disaster. Among
      these was Tom Bangall, the engineer of the Arkansas Thunder. Tom was a
      rearing, tearing, <i>bar</i> state scrouger&mdash;could chaw up any single
      specimen of the human race&mdash;any quantity of tobacco, and drink steam
      without flinching!&mdash;A collapsed flue had blown him once somewhere in
      the altitude of an Alpine height, but dropped him unharmed into the
      Arkansas, and he used to swear that after the steam tried to jerk him
      apart and found it couldn't do it, why, it just dropped the subject, as
      the stump speakers say, by dropping him into the &ldquo;drink&rdquo;&mdash;he
      therefore incontinently set water, hot or cold, at defiance. Tom was,
      withal, a generous, open-hearted, whole-souled fellow, and his cheering
      words to the emigrants on the boiler deck, and many a kind act to a
      suffering passenger, proved that beneath his rough exterior he had a heart
      open to gentle influences. As a further proof of this, Tom had a wife, a
      good wife, too, and what's more he tenderly loved her; but she in vain
      tried to cure him of drinking and swearing. Tom swore that he would swear,
      that a steamboat wouldn't work without some swearing, and if a fellar
      didn't drink he'd bust, and, therefore, it was necessary to take a bust
      now and then to keep out of danger. &ldquo;There is no use,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;in
      blowing off steam from your 'scape-pipe agin it, for it has to be <i>did!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One day on Tom's return home, he found Mrs. Mary Bangall weeping bitterly,
      and Tom became, instantly, correspondingly distressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Polly,&rdquo; inquired he, &ldquo;what's the matter, gal?&mdash;what's hurt you?&mdash;is
      anythin' broke loose that can't be mended?&mdash;what the thunder makes
      you take on so?&mdash;Come, out with the cause, or I shall git a
      blubberin' too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only look here, Tom,&rdquo; said Mary, &ldquo;here's a whole account of how the world
      is going to be destroyed this April.&mdash;Every thing has been counted up
      by Father Miller, and the sum total's a general <i>burn!</i> Now, Tom,
      don't swear, nor drink any more or you won't be able to stand the fire no
      more than gunpowder!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom indulged in a regular guffaw at her distress, and told her she was a
      fool to be frightened at that&mdash;it was all moonshine, humbug&mdash;smoke,&mdash;
      that Father Miller was an old granny, and it warn't possible&mdash;anyhow
      he warn't afraid of fire, &ldquo;so it might <i>fire away!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Tom,&rdquo; continued Mary, &ldquo;let me read to you the proof&mdash;it's
      irresistible, Tom,&mdash;the <i>times</i> and the <i>half times</i>, are
      so correctly added up that there can be no mistake, and if you don't make
      some preparation we will be separated for ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The idea of a separation from Mary troubled Tom, but full of incredulity
      he sat down to listen, more to please her, and find something in the
      adding up of the catastrophe that would upset it. Mary commenced reading,
      and Tom quietly listening, but as she read the awful evidences of a
      general conflagration, the signs of the times, the adding up of the times,
      the proof of their meaning, and the dreadful consequences of being
      unprepared&mdash;with ascension robes, Tom grew serious, and at length
      looked a little frightened. He didn't want Mary to see its effect upon
      him, and so assumed an over quantity of indifference, but it was useless
      for him to attempt hiding his feelings from her prying eyes&mdash;she saw
      Miller's doctrine was grinding a hopper of fear in Tom's heart, and felt
      glad to see its effect. When she ceased he remarked, with a
      half-frightened laugh, that Father Miller ought to be burnt for thus
      trying to frighten people, and, &ldquo;as for them eastern fellars, they are
      half their life crazy any how!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having tried thus to whisper unconcern to his troubled spirit, Tom set out
      for the boat, with the firm resolve, if he caught a Millerite to save him
      from the threatened burning by drowning him, for disseminating any such
      fiery doctrines. When he got on board he told the captain what had
      transpired at home,&mdash;how his wife had got hold of a Miller document
      from a travelling disciple, and, as well as he could, rehearsed the awful
      contents which she had read to him. The captain, observing the effect they
      had produced on Tom, seriously answered that the matter looked squally,
      and he was afraid them documents were all too true.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True!&rdquo; shouted Tom, &ldquo;why, you aint green enough to swallow any such yarn&mdash;its
      parfectly rediculous to talk about burnin' every thing up. I'd like to see
      old Miller set fire to the Massissippi!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Its 110 funny matter, Tom,&rdquo; replied the captain, &ldquo;and if you keep going
      on this way you will find it so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, give us somethin' to drink!&rdquo; shouted Tom to the bar-keeper, (he
      began to get terrified at the serious manner with which the captain
      treated Millerism) &ldquo;come, Bill,&rdquo; said he, addressing the clerk, &ldquo;let's
      take a drink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clerk, who was a wag, saw through the captain's joke in a minute and
      when he winked at him, refused to taste, adding as an apology that &ldquo;on the
      eve of so awful an event as the destruction of the world, he couldn't
      daringly indulge as he formerly did, so he must excuse him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, go to h&mdash;ll, then,&rdquo; says Tom, half mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain sighed, and the clerk put his hand upon his heart, and turned
      his eyes upward, as if engaged in inward prayer for his wicked friend. Tom
      swallowed his glass, and bestowing a fierce look upon the pair remarked,
      that &ldquo;they couldn't come any of them thar shines over him, he wasn't any
      of that <i>chicken breed!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor fellow,&rdquo; muttered the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! Thomas,&rdquo; chimed in the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom slammed the cabin door after him as he went out to descend below,
      swearing at the same time that all the rest of the world were turning
      damned fools as well as old Miller.
    </p>
    <p>
      Steam was raised and the Thunder started. For a time Tom forgot the
      predicted advent, but every time he came up to the bar to get a drink, the
      serious look of the captain and the solemn phiz of the clerk, threw a cold
      chill over him, and made him savage with excitement. Every passenger
      appeared to be talking about Millerism, besides, a waggish friend of the
      captain's, a passenger on board, having been informed of the engineer's
      state of mind, passed himself off as a preacher of the doctrine, and
      talked learnedly on the prophecies whenever the engineer was nigh. It was
      comic to see the fierce expression of their victim's countenance, and how,
      in spite of himself, he would creep up to the circles where they were
      discussing the Second Advent, and listen with all ears to the rehearsal of
      its terrible certainty, then making for the bar, take another drink, and
      thrusting his hands deep into his pockets start down to the engine, with a
      scowl upon his swart countenance that would almost start a flue head from
      its fastenings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd quit this boat,&rdquo; said Tom to his assistant, &ldquo;if it warn't so near
      'the 25th of April,'&mdash;cuss me if I'd stay aboard another minit, fur
      captain and all hands are a set of cowardly <i>pukes!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what's the 25th of April got to do with your leavin', Tom?&rdquo; inquired
      his partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin' particular, but if this confounded blow up or burn up should come
      off on that day, I wan't to be on the river&mdash;its safer; but if I
      should leave now I couldn't get on another boat by that time, and then I'd
      be in a <i>hot</i> fix.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here was a tacit confession by Tom, that he thought there was danger, and
      that there might be some truth in old Miller's prediction. The fact of his
      fears was forthwith communicated to the captain and clerk by Tom's
      partner, and his sufferings became increased&mdash;he could hear no sounds
      but&mdash;<i>advent&mdash;Miller&mdash;bloe-up&mdash;dreadful destruction!</i>&mdash;until
      his suspense became so horrible, that he wished for any termination so it
      would put an end to his dread. His partner ventured to increase his
      uneasiness by talking to him on the subject, but Tom threatened to brain
      him if he said anything about it in his presence&mdash;he remarked that
      &ldquo;the noise of the engine was his only peace, and no frightened, lubberly
      sucker should disturb it by talking Millerism&mdash;if Miller was a goin'
      to burn the world, why, let him burn and be-(here, Tom for the first time
      checked an oath, and finished the sentence with) never mind, just let him
      <i>burn</i>, that's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Starting up to the bar, without looking to right or left, he presented a
      bottle, had it filled with liquor and retreated, resolved to go as little
      as possible near either captain or clerk, for their solemn looking faces
      were contagious&mdash;they looked disaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the 25th of April dawned, and with its advancing hours Tom got
      <i>tight</i>, that is to say, so near intoxicated that he could only move
      around with extreme difficulty&mdash;he knew what he was about, but very
      little more. Sundry mutterings which he gave voice to, now and then,
      proclaimed the spirit at work within, and it would say:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Burn, ha!&mdash;burn up, will it?&mdash;goin' to take a regular bust and
      blow itself out! Great world, this!&mdash;g-r-e-a-t world, and a nice
      little fire it will be!&rdquo; Then, thinking of Mary, he would continue&mdash;&ldquo;Poor
      Mary&mdash;what a shock it will be to her, but she's on the safe side, for
      she belongs to meetin,&rdquo;&mdash;and then he would get wrathy&mdash;&ldquo;Let the
      old world burn, and go to splintered lightnin'&mdash;who cares?&mdash;The
      captain and clerk's got on the safe side, too,&mdash;they're afraid of the
      fire, eh?&rdquo; Then he would cautiously emerge from his place by the engine,
      and peep out upon the sky, to see if the work of destruction was about to
      commence, and then returning, take another pull at the whiskey, until, by
      his frequent libations, he not only got <i>blue</i>, but every thing he
      looked at was multiplying&mdash;he was surrounded by a duplicate set of
      machinery&mdash;even his fist, that he shook at the intruding cylinder and
      piston rod, became doubled before his eyes, and all assumed the color of a
      brimstone blue! Tom became convinced, in his own mind, that the first
      stage of the general convulsion had commenced!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello!&mdash;back her!&rdquo; shouted the captain, &ldquo;give her a lick back!&mdash;starboard
      wheel, there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all up, now,&rdquo; muttered Tom, &ldquo;let's see you <i>lick</i> her back out
      of this scrape,&rdquo; and staggering towards the steam valves, to try the
      amount of water in the boilers, he fell sprawling; at that moment the boat
      struck the bank with a bang that shook every timber in her; the
      concussion, also, injured a conducting steam-pipe just enough to scald
      Tom's face and hands severely, without endangering his life. As the stream
      of hot vapour hit him, he rolled over, exclaiming:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God!&mdash;it's all up, now!&rdquo; and soon became utterly insensible
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom was picked up and carried into the Social Hall, where restoratives
      were administered to recall him to consciousness, and remedies applied to
      heal his burns. All gathered in silence and anxiety around his pallet,
      watching for returning sensibility, the captain and clerk among the
      number, really grieved at the mishap, which they had no doubt was caused
      by their jest. While all breathlessly looked on, Tom gave manifestations
      of returning consciousness: of course, with sensibility returned feeling,
      and his burns appealed, most touchingly, to that sense. Twisting himself
      up, and drawing his breath through his teeth, he slowly remarked:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jest as I thought&mdash;the d&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;l's got me, s-l-i-c-k
      enough, and I'm burnt already to a cinder!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no resisting this&mdash;all hands burst into a roar of laughter.
      Tom couldn't open his eyes, but he could hear, and after they had done
      laughing, he quietly remarked:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These imps are mightily glad because they've got <i>me!</i> Here followed
      another roar, and when it subsided, the captain approached him, and called
      his name&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom, old fellow,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you're safe!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, you here, too, captain? I thought you had jined meetin' and saved
      your bacon.&mdash;So they've got you, too,&mdash;well, a fellar aint alone
      then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the clerk spoke to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, you, too, Bill?&mdash;well, 'there's a party of us,' any how, but
      it's so confounded dark I can't see you, and its hotter than-(here he
      checked himself with a shudder, and added,) Yes, I'm certain we're <i>thar!</i>&rdquo;
       sighing heavily, he murmured&mdash;&ldquo;Poor Mary&mdash;Oh, my Mary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By the efforts of the captain and clerk Tom was made to understand the
      true state of the case, and through their kindness and attention, was soon
      able to return to duty, and though he would after laugh at a jest about
      old Father Miller, yet he was never again known to drink whiskey. When
      irritated now, Tom always shuts his lips tight, and chokes down the rising
      oath. Mary is gratified with the change, although she wept at the severity
      of the means by which he was converted.

      SETTLEMENT FUN. BILL SAPPER'S LETTER TO HIS COUSIN.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Liberti, Missury, May 6t. 18 forty 5.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>ousin Jim, tha
      aint nuthin' occurred wuth ritin' about in our settlement fur a long
      spell, but about the beginnin' of last week, thur war a rumor sot afloat
      in town, which kept the wimen for two or three days in a continooal
      snigger, and it war half a day afore the men could find out the rights of
      the marter&mdash;sech anuther fease as all the gals got inter, war
      delightful to contemplate. The boys kept a askin' one anuther, what in the
      yearth wur the marter, that the gals kept a whisperin' and laffin' round
      town so&mdash;at last it cum out! and what do you think, Jim, wur the
      marter?&mdash;You couldn't guess in a week. It aint no common occurrence,
      and yet it's mighty natral. Little Jo Allen, the shoemaker, had an
      addition to his family, amountin' to jest three babbys&mdash;one boy and
      two gals! His wife is a leetle creatur', but I reckon she's &ldquo;some&rdquo; in
      countin' the census, and sech anuther excitement as her little brood of
      pretty babbys has kicked up among the wimen, is perfectly inticin' to
      bachelors. When the interestin' marter war furst noised about, the wimen
      wouldn't believe it, but to know the rights of it tha put on thur bonnets
      and poured down to see little Mrs. Allen, in a parfect stream of
      curiosity; and, sure enough, thar tha wur, three raal peert lookin'
      children, all jest alike. Bein' an acquaintance of Jo's he tuck me in to
      see his family, and it wur raaly an interestin' sight to see the little
      creaturs. Thar tha wur, with thur tiny faces aside each other, hevin on
      the prettiest caps,&mdash;all made and fixed by the young wimen, as a
      present to the mother,&mdash;and then thur infantile lips jest openin',
      like so many rose buds poutin', while thur bits of hands, transparent as
      sparmacity, wur a curtin' about and pushin', all doubled up, agin thur
      little noses, and thur mother all the time lookin' at 'em so peert and
      pleased, jest as ef she war feelin' in her own mind tha war hard to beat&mdash;addid
      to which, thar stood thur daddy, contemplating with a glow of parentil
      feelin', the whole unanimous pic-tur! It aint in me, Jim, to fully
      describe the univarsel merits of sech a scene, and I guess it couldn't
      receive raal jestis from any man's pen, 'cept he'd ben the father of twins
      at least.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gracious me,&rdquo; sed Mrs. Sutton, a very literary worain, who allays talks
      history on extra occasions, &ldquo;ef that little Mrs. Allen aint ekill to the
      mother of the Grashi!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at little Jo, the daddy, fur a spell, and tuk to admirin' him
      so that she could scacely keep her hands off on him&mdash;she hadn't no
      babbys, poor womin!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Mister Allen,&rdquo; ses she, &ldquo;you are suthin' like a husbind&mdash;you're
      detarmin'd to descend a name down to your ancesters!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I raaly believe she'd a kissed him ef thur hadn't ben so many wimen thar.
      The father of the babbys wur mitely tickled at furst, 'cause all the wimen
      wur a praisin' him, but arter a spell he gin to look skary, for go whar he
      would, he found some wimen tryin' to git a look at him&mdash;tha jest
      besieged his shop winder, all the time, and kept peepin' in, and lookin'
      at him, and askin' his age, and whar he cum from? At last sum of the gals
      got so curious tha asked him whar he did cum from, any how, and as soon as
      he sed Indianee, Dick Mason becum one of the popularest young men in the
      settlement, among the wimen, jest 'cause he war from the same state.
    </p>
    <p>
      Things went on this way fur a spell, till at last tha heerd of 'em in the
      country, and the wimen all about found some excuse to come to town to git
      store goods, jest a purpose to see the babbys and thur parents. The little
      daddy war wusser plagued now, and they starr'd at him so that he couldn't
      work&mdash;the fact wur his mind war gittin' troubled, and some of the
      wimen noticed the skary look he had out of his eyes, and kept a wonderin'
      what it meant. One mornin' it war noticed by some of the gals that his
      shop warn't open'd, so tha got in-quirin' about him, and arter a sarch he
      cum up missin'&mdash;well, I'm of the opinion thar wur an excitement in
      town then, fully ekill to the president's election. Every womin started
      her husbind out arter Jo, with orders not to cum back without him, and
      sech a scourin' as tha gin the country round would a caught anythin' human&mdash;it
      did ketch Jo&mdash;on his road to Texas! When tha got him back in the town
      agin, a committee of married men held a secret talk with him, to larn what
      the marter wur, that he wanted to clear out, and Jo told 'em that the
      wimen kept a starin' at him so he couldn't work, and ef he war kept from
      his bisness, and his family continooed to increase three at a time, he'd
      git so cussed poor he'd starve, and tharfore he knew it 'ud be better to
      clar out, for the wimen would be sure to take good care of his wife and
      the babbys.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Dr. Wilkins wur appinted by the men to wait on a meetin' of the wimen,
      and inform them of the fact, that tha wur annoyin' the father of the three
      babbys, and had amost driven him out'n the settlement The Doctor,
      accordin' to appintment, informed the wimen, and arter he had retired tha
      went into committee of the whole, upon the marter, and appinted three of
      thur number to report at a meetin', on the next evenin', a set of
      resolutions tellin' what tha'd do in the premises, and governin' female
      action in the partickler case of Jo Allen, his little wife, and three
      beautiful healthy babbys.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the hour of meetin' had arriv, Mrs. Sutton's parlors wur crowded with
      the wimen of the settlement, and arter appinten Widder Dent to the cheer
      tha reported the committee on resolves reddy, and Mrs. Sutton bein' the
      head of the committee she sot to work and read the followin' drawn up
      paper:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereas, It has ben sed by the wise Solomon of old that the world must be
      peopled, tharfore, we hold it to be the inviolate duty of every man to git
      married, and, moreover, rear up citizens and future mothers to our
      glorious republick; and,
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereas, It is gratifyin' to human natur', the world in gineral, Missury
      at large, and Liberty in partickler, that this seltlement has set an
      example to the ancesters of future time; which will not only make the
      wimen of this enlightened state a pattern for thur children, but a envy to
      the royal wimen of Europe, not forgettin' the proud mother of the Lions of
      Ingland, but will elevate and place in and among the furst families, fur
      ever here-arter, the mother that has shed such lustre upon the sex in
      gineral; and
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereas, It is the melancholy lot of some to be deprived of doin' thar
      duty in the great cause of human natur', because the young men is back'ard
      about speak-in' out, it is time that some measures be taken inimical to
      our general prosperity, and encouragin' to the risin' generation of young
      fellars round town; tharfore,
    </p>
    <p>
      Resolved, That, as married wimen, our sympathies, like the heavin' of
      natur's bosom, yearns with admiration and respect fur that little womin,
      Mrs. Allen, and as we see her three dear little babbys, reclinin' upon
      thur mother's female maternal bosom, our beatin' hearts with one accord
      wish we could say ditto.
    </p>
    <p>
      Resolved, That in the case of Mrs. Allen we see an illustrious example of
      the intarnal and extarnal progress of that spreadin' race, the Angel
      Saxons; and time will come when the mothers of the west will plant thar
      glorious shoots from one pinnacle of the Rocky Mountains to the tother,
      and until thar cry of liberti will be hollered from one pint to the next
      in a continooal skreech!
    </p>
    <p>
      Resolved, That Mister Joseph Allen, the father of these three dear little
      babbys, shall receive a monument at his deth, and while he is livin', the
      wimen shall ony visit his shop once a week to look at him, 'cept the
      married wimen, who shall be permitted to see him twice a week and no
      offener, pervided and exceptin' tha want to git measured fur a par of
      shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Resolved, Mister Joseph Allen shall hev the custom of the whole
      settlement, for he is a glorious livin' example of a dotin' husbind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arter these resolutions had ben unanimously passed, Mrs. Sutton addressed
      the meetin', in a stream of elegance, wharin she proved, clar as a
      whistle, that a family war the furst consideration fur a settler in a new
      country and town lots the arter question. &ldquo;She acknowledged the corn,&rdquo; she
      sed, &ldquo;that it war soothin' to look often at thur neighbor Allen, but his
      peace of mind war the property of his family, and she hoped the ladies
      wouldn't disturb it, 'cause the loss of sech a husbind, would be a
      sufferin' calamity to the settlement.&rdquo; The meetin' adjourned, and Jo went
      back to work, singin' and whistlin' as happy as usual, and ever sence he's
      had a parfect shower of work, for the gals all round the country keep
      goin' to him to git measured, tha say he desarves to be incouraged.
    </p>

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>om C. H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      Esq., a genius, whose ideas of life were on such a magnificent scale that
      they outran his interest, capital and all, was seated upon the porch of a
      fashionable hotel, in a large eastern village, one bright Monday morning,
      cogitating how, in the nature of things, it was possible for him to
      compass a dinner. The long score, unpaid, which stood recorded on the
      books within, precluded the idea of getting one there without the <i>tin</i>,
      and numerous searches through sundry pockets about his person were
      unrewarded by a single shiner. The case was desperate, but great minds are
      always equal to great emergencies, and Tom's was of that order. His coat
      had been renovated by a scourer, for whom he had written a love letter,
      his hat had been ironed by a good-natured hatter, who had enjoyed his
      custom in better days, a new coat of japan varnish had been lavished upon
      his cane, his dicky was passable, and no gentleman would think of
      examining the extremities of his covering, or pry into the shifts he had
      been put to for a shirt. Tom thought himself passable, and he resolved to
      pass off for a dinner, if possible. A stranger lolling easily on a settee
      near him looked vulnerable, and Tom, approaching him in a very bland and
      friendly manner, remarked:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, sir, but you look so like an old friend of mine, J. B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      who has resided for years in the south, that I can't help addressing you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am from the south, sir,&rdquo; answered the stranger, courteously, &ldquo;but not
      the person you speak of&mdash;know him, however, and am pleased to
      encounter a friend of his.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's it,&rdquo; said Tom to himself, &ldquo;got him as easy as rolling off a log!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An animated conversation ensued, which ended by Tom being asked to dine,
      and when the gong proclaimed the table spread, in walked the stranger and
      Tom, arm-in-arm, large as life and twice as natural. He called the waiters
      with an air of ease, passed the stranger's wine with friendly freedom,
      laughed musically, jested with spirit, wiped his mouth with grace, and, in
      short, completely captivated the southerner. During the period of Tom's
      luxuriating, he was observed by the landlord, who, indignant, sent a
      servant to order him from the table. Tom had &ldquo;come it&rdquo; over him for so
      many odd dinners, without a shadow of prospect for pay, that he would
      stand it no longer. The servant approached, whispered in his ear, and
      stood off to give him room to <i>move</i>. Tom clutched the wine bottle,
      with the intention of hurling it at his head, but altered his purpose, and
      poured out another glass, drank it off, looked daggers at the servant, and
      in a moment more smiled confidence upon his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you believe it,&rdquo; said Tom, to the southerner, &ldquo;that since my
      absence from the city for a few days past, a rival house of our <i>shipping
      firm</i> has whispered the possibility of our failure, and this rascally
      landlord, having heard the calumny, has insulted me here at table by
      sending a servant to demand the trifling sum I owe him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The southerner was burning with indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is too humiliating;&rdquo; added Tom, &ldquo;not dreaming of such an outrage, I am
      entirely unprovided at the moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, my dear fellow,&rdquo; promptly proffered his friend, &ldquo;here is my
      pocket-book, make use of it without hesitation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're very kind,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;very, I will but borrow this thousand
      dollar bill for a moment&mdash;I know the rascal can't change it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With an air of offended dignity, Tom approached the office of the hotel,
      the landlord, frowning with anger, stood at the desk, the offended &ldquo;diner
      out,&rdquo; put his hand to his eyes, as if hiding deep emotion, and then
      addressing the landlord in a grief-stricken voice, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never dreamed of such an insult from <i>you</i>, sir, at such a time,
      too, just as my uncle in the south has expired,&mdash;and his agent with
      me to deliver up the portion bequeathed to me&mdash;it is&mdash;it&mdash;sir,
      I cannot express in language my feelings. Take out of that the paltry sum
      I owe you,&rdquo;&mdash;throwing down the thousand dollar bill,&mdash;&ldquo;and
      henceforth I never will enter your door. Just at a time too,&rdquo; he further
      added, &ldquo;when I had intended to make your house my home, and endeavor to
      make some return for your forbearance. It is too much&mdash;my feelings
      are lacerated,&rdquo; and here he became almost overpowered by emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strip of crape around his hat&mdash;put there to hide the greasy band&mdash;the
      thousand dollar bill, and the renovated coat, which looked like new on the
      possessor of such a sum, all assured the landlord that he had been <i>hasty</i>.
      He, therefore, denied the indignity, straight, said that it was an
      impertinence of his servant, who had <i>twice</i> before offended his best
      guests by his insolence, and assured Tom that he would discharge the
      fellow forthwith&mdash;pushed back to him the thousand dollar bill, and
      begged he would forget the circumstance&mdash;indeed, he felt shocked that
      such an outrage had been perpetrated upon his <i>oldest</i> friend and
      customer. These warm expressions mollified Tom's wrath, and folding up his
      bill he walked back, resumed his seat, returned the bill to the
      southerner, merely remarking he had &ldquo;brought the landlord to his
      feelings,&rdquo; and cheerfully sipped a <i>little</i> iced champagne. As he
      left the table arm-in-arm with his friend, the landlord approached,
      bowing, and begged to know where he should send for his trunk, as No. 24,
      a fine airy room, which would suit him to a charm, was at present empty.
      Tom said he would send the baggage up, and after lighting a choice Havana,
      strolled out with an air aristocratic.
    </p>
    <p>
      In good time, the trunk arrived&mdash;a rude one, but <i>very heavy</i>.
      The landlord winked as the servant bent beneath its weight, and remarked,
      as he paid the porterage, that a large quantity of bullion was generally
      rather heavy. Tom was in clover&mdash;the thousand dollar bill got
      whispered about, and one of his creditors, a fashionable tailor, insisted
      on trusting him for another suit; he yielded after much persuasion, and it
      was astonishing how everything altered with Tom's appearance. His note was
      good for any small sum now, and it was a pleasure to make his
      acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of about six months the landlord thought he would just hint
      to Tom that a small check would be agreeable, as they were hard pushed.
      The hint was given, and he received a <i>check</i>&mdash;anything but a
      cash one, though. Tom very coolly informed him that the agent who had
      raised his hopes was a rascally impostor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the thousand dollar bill, Mr. H.?&rdquo; said the landlord, inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was handed to me, by the rogue, to keep up appearances,&rdquo; coolly responded
      Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall seize your baggage, sir!&rdquo; cried the enraged host.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't help it, my dear fellow,&rdquo; said Tom; &ldquo;you know if I had a 'pocket
      full of rocks,' you should share them, for I like you, vastly&mdash;I do&mdash;cuss
      me if I don't; so keep cool, and keep the baggage until I make a draw and
      raise the little sum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The trunk was seized, and so roughly that it burst open, when the landlord
      discovered that if Tom had no pocket full of rocks, it was because he had
      stowed them all in his trunk, and that accounted very naturally for its
      being so heavy!

      WHO IS SIR GEORGE SIMPSON? AN EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCE ABOUT HIM.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>n esteemed friend
      of ours, who now, heaven rest his spirit, sleeps in the tomb, had a
      curious method of relating a story; and if his hearer was of an impatient
      nature, it would be sorely tried before he heard the conclusion of any
      yarn the &ldquo;Consul&rdquo; might start to favor him with. On one occasion, some
      months since, he seated himself at my elbow, while I was busily perusing a
      piece of news in which Sir George Simpson's name appeared, and taking the
      knight's cognomen for a text, he insisted on relating to me an
      extraordinary circumstance, which drew forth a correspondingly
      extraordinary remark from the said Sir George. With a pencil, unperceived
      by the relater, I stenographed his story, nearly word for word, and as it
      is replete with interest, I do not feel justified in withholding it at the
      present time from the public; so, here it is:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell you an <i>extraordinary</i> circumstance about George Simpson,&rdquo;
       said the &ldquo;Consul.&rdquo; &ldquo;You see, when I was at my brother's, on Staten Island,
      some years since&mdash;at his country seat, living with his family&mdash;(my
      brother Bill, it was)&mdash;there was some six children, and I lived at
      home there&mdash;the oldest not more than fourteen, and I used to take him
      out hunting with me;&mdash;the young rascal was a good shot, too! You see
      I was there at that time on my oars, doing nothing, and had plenty of time
      to spare, which I used to fill up by fishing and hunting, sometimes for
      days together&mdash;pretty poor luck at that, often, but I didn't care, as
      time wasn't valuable. Well, you see, my brother Bill used to invite some
      of the people in the neighborhood to dinner, and often there were
      distinguished visiters on the island&mdash;it's a first rate place in
      summer&mdash;and Bill had every thing nice on his table; he took some
      trouble to keep it fine, and he had a reputation for being a good liver.
      You could see he liked good things by his appearance, for he was
      corpulent. Well, you see, Sir George Simpson happened to be invited to
      dine&mdash;Sir George, the Scotchman, old fellow&mdash;belonging to the
      Hudson Bay Fur Company; Scotch as the devil!&mdash;old tory at that; he
      has travelled all over the north-western territory, and Oregon, and clear
      up to Behring's Strait; knows the worth of a wild-cat skin in any market
      in the world, old Sir George does&mdash;a cursed old Jew, too! Well, as we
      were all seated at the table&mdash;I on my brother Bill's right, and Sir
      George on his left&mdash;(Sir George was dressed in check pants and a
      snuff-colored coat, looking as pompous as the red lion of England,
      although he was only a Scotch clerk of the Fur Company)&mdash;-just as
      Bill's oldest boy asked for something at table, and I was help-him to a
      bit of veal kidney&mdash;the young rascal was fond of kidney, and would
      have it when it was on the table&mdash;says Sir George, says he&mdash;and
      my brother Bill, who was just turning up his plate at the time, stopped
      and laid down his fork, and I turned round to hear what he had to say&mdash;(the
      old fellow always spoke slow, with considerable Scotch accent, and every
      body wanted to hear&mdash;it's the most extraordinary circumstance or
      remark, whichever you please, as I said, that ever I heard)&mdash;says Sir
      George, says he, '<i>I shouldn't wonder if we have to fight about Oregon
      yet!</i>'&rdquo;

    <h2>
      LETTERS FROM A BABY. BY A FORWARD CHILD.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>t. Louis has
      obtained the reputation of being a dangerous climate for infants, and the
      bills of mortality, as they have from time to time exhibited an alarming
      number of deaths among children, have called forth learned disquisitions
      from the &ldquo;medicine men,&rdquo; and some new views from those who are without the
      pale of regular practice. All seemed to agree that the mortality every
      summer was alarming, but no two united in assigning the same cause for the
      fatal result. After listening patiently to both sides, I sought
      information from the suffering party, and their opinion may be gathered
      from the complaints of their correspondent <i>Bub</i>. He says:
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Sir:&mdash;Of late I perceive the public are making some stir about
      us babies; may heaven vouchsafe healthy children to our defenders. I have
      a string of sorrows to relate myself, and my poor bowels cry out for
      protection; you must therefore permit me to say a few words. My Ma is what
      you would call a fashionable woman, and although she loves her baby, yet
      she says it is not fashionable for mammas in the southern states to nurse
      their own babies; I am, consequently, turned over to the care of nigger
      Molly, and Lord preserve me, such nursing as I get would kill a young <i>Indian</i>.
      I am fed with every thing, from a green apple to a chunk of fat pickled
      pork, and the sufferings which I undergo therefrom, would crack a sucking
      bottle, or rend a diaper in tatters. After feeding me into sickness, they
      set a doctor at me, who physics me into a state of quiet insensibility,
      and they then say, &ldquo;bess its ittle bessed heart it's ditten better, it
      is.&rdquo; I get a little peace until I get strong enough to cry out, and then
      nigger Molly stuffs me to keep me quiet, and I go through another spell. I
      see our dog Flora watching her pups, and if any person goes near them she
      is almost ready to tear them to pieces; I wish my Ma was as careful of me.
      I see a poor woman opposite kissing her baby, and I envy that child;
      nobody kisses me but black Molly, and she does it to smother my cries of
      suffering. I don't know what kills other babies, but this treatment will
      soon finish me Bub.
    </p>
    <h3>
      NO. II.-BUB IN PERIL.
    </h3>
    <p>
      <i>How are you?</i>&mdash;You have published my letter, and I am glad to
      see that nigger Molly cannot smother my cry to the public&mdash;if I don't
      give her <i>scissors</i>, it will be because she smothers me outright. You
      must know Molly keeps two bottles filled with liquid, one of which she
      administers to me, and the other to herself, and they both have about the
      same effect, only hers smells worst. Hers she calls <i>whiskey</i>, mine
      <i>cordial</i>. The other morning Molly set me down on the floor, beside a
      pan of water, and commenced taking comfort from her bottle, and I, feeling
      feverish, commenced comforting myself by dabbling in the pan until I was
      all wet; Molly perceiving this picked me up to <i>slap</i> me, but her
      cordial floored her. I should have been glad of this, only she nearly
      killed me in her fall, and because I screamed, as any baby would do, she
      clapped her black lips to mine, smelling horribly as they were of whiskey,
      and kept in my breath until I was as black in the face as herself. I
      yelled at this double outrage, and she silenced me by pouring a double
      dose of <i>cordial</i> down my throat, which threw me into a state of
      insensibility, from which I awoke almost dead. My mother asked to see me,
      and when she heard me moaning, she said &ldquo;the ittle bessed dear is
      suffering wis its too-sys.&rdquo; I aint suffering with my teeth&mdash;I'm
      suffering with nigger Moll's nursing.

      my infantile head, and bright visions of a pair of small breeches to be
      worn by me, float airily round my head&mdash;they appear plain and
      palpable in the vista of the future&mdash;buttons, pockets, suspenders and
      all&mdash;<i>vive la pantalons!</i> The other morning my Pa drew forth the
      copies of the Reveille from his book case, and commenced reading them for
      Ma's amusement. Suddenly he cast his eye on my letters, and straight he
      commenced them&mdash;he laughed, and then Ma laughed, and then I crowed.
      By and by, as he proceeded, Ma began to look angry; she cast a glance at
      me, and then her conscience smote her&mdash;I was wasted to a shadow&mdash;on
      went Pa with the letters; Ma wept, I crowed, and nigger Molly gave me a <i>pinch</i>&mdash;a

      Molly fled, Pa chuckled to himself, and I crowed again&mdash;I tried to
      hurrah! How shall I describe the change which stole over me, body and
      spirit, as, nestling in my mother's sweet bosom and receiving her fond
      caress, I was permitted abundantly to drink at &ldquo;Nature's pure fount,
      which, at my cry, sent forth a pearly stream to cherish my enamelled
      veins.&rdquo; A sweet sleep visited my pillow again, and the fond endearments
      which waited on my waking moments were life and joy to me. My Ma, now, is
      rapidly improving in health&mdash;I, of course, will grow fat; and just
      wait until I'm able to wear them breeches and beat a small drum, if I

      them teeth for nothing; I find a fellow don't get knowledge without paying
      for it; I suffered in teething, but I learned some. Women who pay no
      attention to their babies, envy me my fat&mdash;I'm a kind of living
      rebuke to them, and, for a year old, I'm rather a heavy rebuke. They every

      why don't you let Molly relieve you of such a load?&rdquo; Ma answers, &ldquo;It's

      <i>Gents:&mdash;How d'ye do?</i> I've just had a good long pull at the

      comfortable, I think I'll give you another small epistle. I'm going to get
      into trouble&mdash;I feel it in my bones. My Ma has quarreled with her old
      physician, and has employed a new one, young Dr. Pliant&mdash;between you
      and me, I think they should have named him <i>Verdant</i>. This new doctor

      evidence against my comfort is reiterated to my mother. &ldquo;Do you really
      think, Dr. P., that I am endangering my health?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That depends upon how you feel,&rdquo; says the doctor. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; says Ma, &ldquo;I feel
      as well as ever I did in my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your system, then,&rdquo; says the doctor, &ldquo;is what we call in the south <i>sui
      generis</i>&mdash;that is, you can stand nursing, and, consequently, the
      babe having a tendency to the natural milk which surreptitiously flows, I
      might say, from the secretive portion of the female <i>os frontis</i> of
      the breast, it must follow, as a result from these multifarious and
      indigenous effects, that no danger can ensue from your nursing.&rdquo; I'm safe
      as long as my mother keeps in good health; but Lord bless me, should she
      get ill, I'm a gone <i>sucker</i>&mdash;this new physician would dose her
      and me into kingdom come in about a week. I heard quite a discussion about
      his merits yesterday. Mrs. Enquiry says that he used to be a fiddler about
      two years ago, but Mrs. Helpalong says it is no such thing&mdash;that he
      always was a gentleman, and taught school before he took up the profession&mdash;that
      he studied regularly a whole season, and took his diploma in the spring;&mdash;she
      sticks to that, Mrs. Helpalong does, and I guess she is about right. Aint
      my case critical? Bub.

      NO. VI.-bub's RECEPTION OF A SILVER PAP SPOON.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>I'm here again</i>:&mdash;Important events having transpired since I
      last wrote to you, it has been deemed proper to send a synopsis of them to
      you for publication, in order that the world in general may know western
      babies are <i>some</i>, and when well nursed a good deal <i>more</i> than
      some. A most gratifying reformation has been effected in certain circles
      by my letters, and, indeed, wherever they have been read, nigger nurses,
      paregoric, sucking-bottles, coarse diapers, and sundry other abuses have
      entirely disappeared. The effect has been a corresponding improvement in
      babies, generally, and your correspondent in particular, who is now
      admitted to be a <i>whapping</i> child for a small family.
    </p>
    <p>
      On last Christmas, a number of our parents having met together to
      celebrate the day, all of us youngsters were put into the nursery
      together, and the clatter of discussion which followed would have thrown a
      peevish nurse into hysterics. Charley Wilgus proposed that a meeting
      should be held upon the spot, and a <i>silver pap spoon</i> voted to me
      for my able letters in defence of infantile rights. Asa Keemle seconded
      the motion, and it was unanimously carried. Charley Wilgus was thereupon
      chosen chairman, and Asa Keemle, secretary. The president mounted a
      pillow, and called the meeting to order by ringing the bells on his coral.
      On motion, a committee was then appointed to draft resolutions expressive
      of the sense of the meeting, and the following boys, having cut their
      eye-teeth, were selected to draft said resolutions:
    </p>
    <p>
      Augustus Vinton, Edward Shade, John Charless, Christopher Wigery, John
      Dalrymple and Wallace Finney.
    </p>
    <p>
      The committee having retired, Colton A. Presbury, Jr., offered the
      following resolution, which he prefaced by some very pertinent remarks:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Resolved</i>, That cutting teeth is a sharp operation, and should
      therefore, be deferred until maturity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presbury G. A. Colton, a little fellow who had just cut his first
      &ldquo;double,&rdquo; opposed this resolution, on the ground of its interfering with
      &ldquo;future prospects,&rdquo;&mdash;he went in for teeth now, and the cutting to
      come being left an open question. The resolution was rejected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rucker Smith now rose to address the meeting, when some objection was made
      to him because he sucked milk from a bottle; it was, however, concluded
      that he might address the chair if his diaper was pinned tight; on
      examination he was permitted to proceed. He commenced describing the
      horrors of a <i>cold bath</i>, and was interrupted by the president, who
      informed him that the subject of water came more particularly under the
      head of streams, and could not then be entertained by the meeting. He then
      proceeded to describe the delights of a <i>sucking-bottle</i>, and was
      cried down by the unanimous voice of the meeting. Some one now commenced a
      speech against <i>paregoric</i>, whereupon the assembly, speaker and all,
      went immediately to <i>sleep!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      They were aroused from their slumber by the return of the committee,
      which, through their chairman, Augustus Vinton, reported the following
      resolutions:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Resolved</i>, That babies are, and of right ought to be, natural-born
      <i>suckers</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Resolved</i>, That the introduction of negro nurses among white babies
      was a <i>dark</i> era in infantile history.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Resolved</i>, That all artificial efforts, in regard to babies, are no
      go, and that the old fashion defies the ingenuity of Yankeedom to improve
      on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Resolved</i>, That &ldquo;being born with a silver spoon in your mouth&rdquo; is a
      good thing, but an unlimited chance at the <i>titty</i> is a better.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Resolved</i>, That all anti-nursing mothers are undeserving of lively
      husbands.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Resolved</i>, That we look with feelings of compassion upon those who
      have <i>adopted</i> children.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Resolved</i>, That <i>Bub</i> deserves a <i>silver pap spoon</i>, and
      shall have one.
    </p>
    <p>
      These resolutions having been unanimously adopted by the meeting, it was&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      On motion of O. M. Ridgely, seconded by Edward 'Shade, adjourned. A
      general call was now made for refreshments, which anxious mothers promptly
      supplied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours, Bub.

    <h2>
      SETH TINDER'S FIRST COURTSHIP, HOW HIS FLAME WAS QUENCHED!
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">Y</span>ou knew Seth
      Tinder,&mdash;No?&mdash;&ldquo;git eout!&rdquo;&mdash;you did know Seth, every body
      knew him, and they couldn't help it, for Seth would know every body. He
      was, perhaps, the &ldquo;cutest critter,&rdquo; in some things, that ever calculated
      the success of a notion expedition, and he was among the first of his
      genus that ever strayed, on such an expedition, as far west as St. Louis.
      If you really didn't know Seth, it is time your ignorance was enlightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seth was remarkably cute at driving a bargain&mdash;that was an innate
      propensity; Seth was inquisitive, and frequently looked into hall doors,
      and peeped into kitchen windows&mdash;that was Yankee human nature; Seth
      winked at the girls&mdash;that was an acquired habit; he resolved to
      possess one&mdash;that was a <i>calculation</i>. Now, this winking at the
      girls, when performed by a handsome individual, is looked upon as a matter
      of course; but Seth was so notoriously ugly, that his wink was an outrage,
      and his overtures of love, perfect atrocities. His short, bow-legged
      figure was thatched with the most obstinate bunch of carroty hair that
      ever bid defiance to bear's oil, and the windows of his mind as the eyes
      are poetically styled, appeared looking intently at the tip of his nose,
      as if apprehensive that, ere long, it would burst into a blaze. A kind of
      half-burnt-prairie garnished his chin, which would have made a very warm
      looking goatee, if Seth could have transplanted it all to one spot; but
      there lay the difficulty, for though cute at driving a bargain,' he could
      make none with nature&mdash;she made him ugly without his consent, and
      wouldn't agree to any alteration. Seth, nevertheless, would wink at the
      girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first tender effort was made upon the heart of a German butcher's
      fair, fat, rosy daughter, whose round cheeks and well-fed form was, to his
      eye, the very perfection of female beauty. No artificial making up about
      her&mdash;no exterior padding, it was all done naturally, on the inside.
      As she luxuriated upon the door steps of an evening, Seth would linger
      near, wink, and grin all sorts of affection, but, like all bashful swains,
      hesitated about coming to close quarters. He had imbibed the erroneous
      opinion, that all true courting must be done clandestinely; but all his
      hints to draw his inamorata into a secret treaty, was a failure. At
      length, he ventured in a desperate manner up to the door step, and
      whispered hurriedly:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look out&mdash;comin' to set up with you to-night&mdash;round the back
      way&mdash;over the fence&mdash;be a-waitin'!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd petter pe ketch'd,&rdquo; was the fair one's rejoinder, accompanied by a
      malicious laugh, which Seth interpreted as an approving one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The darkness of the night favored Seth's clandestine opinions and practice&mdash;it
      was just the thing for a nocturnal visit; therefore, agreeable to notice,
      he made his appearance at the fence, round the back way. Leaning over the
      barrier, he ventured to sound a cautious &ldquo;hist,&rdquo; which was immediately
      answered by a low &ldquo;wou-ugh.&rdquo; That must be Dutch for &ldquo;come,&rdquo; reasoned Seth,
      and straight he mounted the fence; but politician never took an uneasier
      seat on the same line of division than he <i>enjoyed</i> on the present
      occasion, for, no sooner had one pedal extremity reached the other side
      and placed him fairly astride, than a remarkably savage dog seized the
      intruding member, with a fierce &ldquo;wou-ugh-ugh-ugh-u.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Git eout, you blasted critter!&rdquo; shouted Seth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wou-ugh-ugh!&rdquo; roared the dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      A struggle ensued, in which Seth, unfortunately, fell on the wrong side,
      right into the jaws of his antagonist. The attitude in which he reached
      terra firma, offered the dog a change of grip, and, like a skilful
      sentinel, he seized the advantage and Seth's seat of honor at the same
      time. Our hero sprang nearly erect, with a howl more like his antagonist
      than any human noise, and a desperate struggle, mingled with strange
      cries, aroused the dozing butcher from his pipe, and the fair cause of the
      disturbance from her knitting.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Sum tam rascal's after der sausages in der smoke haus!&rdquo; was the butcher's
      first exclamation; the rosy daughter smiled assent, and &ldquo;arm and out,&rdquo; was
      the work of an instant. They found their trusty sentry baulking all Seth's
      efforts to retreat over the fence, and keeping him &ldquo;<i>a-wailin''</i>&rdquo; when
      he would have given worlds to leave. The reinforcement made at him with
      whip and broomstick, and this terrible odds aroused him to superhuman
      exertions;&mdash;with a &ldquo;mazzle&rdquo; he floored the Dutchman and his pipe,
      charged on the flinty-hearted daughter, captured her broomstick, beat a
      parley with it on the dog's head, and retreated over the fence with
      &ldquo;flying colors&rdquo;&mdash;<i>stickinng through a rent of his inexpressibles</i>.

    <h2>
      THE DEATH STRUGGLE; OR, THE WAY SMITH DID UP JONES.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">Y</span>ou all knew Smith&mdash;every
      body knew Smith, and Smith was known by every body&mdash;consequently,
      Smith was considered somebody. A body is supposed to contain a soul;
      Smith's body not only contained a soul, but certain parts of Smith's body
      made and mended other men's <i>soles</i>. Smith was enterprising,
      industrious, and won thereby the sole control of the boot and shoe
      business of the flourishing town of Kipp. Smith was a thriving man, a
      persevering man; Smith was, in fact, a strip of upper-leather. Just about
      the time of his greatest success, when the tide of fortune appeared to
      bear upon its surface a perfect skin of Smith's manufactured high-lows,
      and earth shook beneath the tread of his patent cork soles, along came <i>Jones</i>.
      Strange freak of fate! Jones was an adventurer,&mdash;a desperate
      adventurer,&mdash;a fellow who had made <i>soles</i> his study and upper
      leather his dream; he was a Napoleon in his business, and could slash
      calf-skin into a killing shape for pedal extremities;&mdash;in short, he
      was boot No. 1, both in the manufacture and sale of the article. In Jones'
      wanderings along the streets of Kipp, his eye fell upon the broad sign of
      &ldquo;<i>Smith, Fashionable Boot and Shoe Maker</i>.&rdquo; There was something
      prosperous and aristocratic about it, but, at the &ldquo;Fashionable,&rdquo; Jones
      turned up his nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ox-hide fashion,&rdquo; says Jones, &ldquo;Good common article, but won't sell
      alongside of a prime one. I'll drive that fellow, Smith, out of Kipp town&mdash;have
      it all to myself&mdash;do a smashing business&mdash;re-sole the town&mdash;become
      upper-leather in the community&mdash;president of town council&mdash;die
      mayor of the borough, and have all my own manufactured shoes walking at my
      funeral.&mdash;Lofty thought,&rdquo; added Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a very short time, upon the principal street in Kipp, in sight of
      Smith's, out swung a large <i>flag</i>, with the name of &ldquo;Jones, importer,
      manufacturer, and patent leather boot and shoe <i>artiste</i>.&rdquo; Smith
      stared, the flag fluttered, and Jones chuckled. Customers began to
      patronise Jones, and the flag seemed saucily to triumph, as it floated
      upon the breeze blowing towards Smith's door. Smith was a man of energy,
      though, and out came his new &ldquo;patent gaiter boot;&rdquo; the tide turned and
      Smith was again in the ascendant. Now began a leather war&mdash;Jones up
      and Smith down, Smith up again and Jones down, as each rival, alternately,
      brought out something new. At length, one bright morning, the inhabitants
      of Kipp, who had taken sides in the contest, were astounded by the
      appearance of the front of Smith's store&mdash;it was one entire sign,
      from the pavement to the roof. Jones looked blue, the flag fluttered like
      a tattered rag. Smith rose in importance&mdash;his friends felt proud of
      him&mdash;it was a Kipp triumph over foreign capital&mdash;the Jones party
      wavered!&mdash;not so Jones; his great mind had conceived a stupendous
      overthrow for Smith, and ere admiration for his rival had settled into
      sure success, it was diverted to himself. An immense flag, <i>of stone</i>,
      with his name in large letters, was scientifically planted right in the
      centre of Jones' pavement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The town now became feverish with excitement, and it was rumored that the
      town council intended to consider the matter&mdash;the &ldquo;signs of the
      times&rdquo; grew alarming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glorious Smith!&mdash;Smith for ever!&mdash;unyielding to the last! In
      this emergency, when the horizon seem'd heavy with defeat, when a vast
      stone seemed to press his fortunes into the earth, Smith arose, Phonix
      like, &ldquo;from a boot,&rdquo; and gave assurance to the world that he was no common
      leather. Rapid as the thought which conceived the idea, he had a vast boot
      constructed, placed upon a post in front of his door, and with a sample of
      his manufacture in each hand, he mounted into it, to exhibit to the
      passers by not only a spectacle of indomitable energy, but un-<i>flag</i>ging
      perseverance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of Smith now?&rdquo; said the adherents of the &ldquo;big boot,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;bravo,
      Smith!&rdquo; shouted the Kippites. Here was a climax to which ingenuity could
      discover no parallel, it was indeed the <i>ne plus ultra</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jones put his hands behind his coat-tails, and looked up street at the big
      boot and its tenant, then at the stone flag beneath his feet, and his
      countenance settled into a calm and desperate determination. &ldquo;I'll do it!&rdquo;
       exclaimed he. The expression was caught up by his friends, wafted through
      the town, and whispered in each dwelling, until the excitement and
      expectation grew painful. Everybody was aching to see what Jones <i>would
      do</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jones cut out a capacious pair of boots, set his workmen at them, had them
      finished, sent every living soul away from his shop at early candle-light,
      closed it up, and all remained a mystery for the remainder of the night.
      Morning broke&mdash;astonishment and horror!&mdash;terrible Jones!&mdash;triumphing
      in death! He had drawn on the immense boots, fastened them by suspenders
      across his shoulders, and then suspended himself from the flag-staff right
      over the <i>flag-stone</i>. Beneath him fluttered a postscript attached to
      the boots; its substance was, &ldquo;Has Smith the sole to imitate this?&rdquo; <i>Smith
      hadn't</i>.

    <h2>
      &ldquo;WHO ARE THEY?&rdquo; A QUESTION OF VITAL IMPORT.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>ow often, in our
      democratic land, the query which forms our caption has caused the
      aspirants after aristocratic distinction to shudder, and how silent become
      their voices of high pretension, when, by some unfortunate remark, or the
      recalling of some reminiscence, they have been forced to take a
      retrospective glance into the past for a few generations. Happy are they
      if memory does not wake up a sturdy ancester pounding the leather upon his
      lapstone, or that necessary craftsman, the tailor, plying his busy needle
      upon the shop-board. The morbid desire of us republicans to be ignorant of
      the <i>vulgar</i> callings of life, is often very amusing; and the
      struggles to rake up a pedigree, to give character to growing prosperity,
      has often caused more trouble and vexation than the building up of a
      fortune, which it was necessary thus to adorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo; was the general query at a soiree given by a high United
      States' officer, at the city of Washington, a short period previous to the
      death of the lamented General Harrison. The parties who called forth the
      query were a western member of congress and his highly gifted lady. The
      member was in the prime of life, of acknowledged talents in his
      profession, and betrayed, in his manners, the high breeding of a
      gentleman. A conscious power lent ease to his frankness, and the men of
      the west clustered around him with pride. His lady, simply attired,
      attracted all eyes; her <i>distingue</i> figure and intellectual face
      proclaimed her a peerless woman, and when she smiled a ray of heaven's own
      light beamed forth from human eyes. There was a kindness in her smile
      which won hearts before they knew her; there was no hollow mockery in it;
      it came forth from a happy heart, and where its influence fell, good
      feelings sprung up and sweet thoughts clustered; but&mdash;Who is she? Ah,
      that's the question; and how often the inquiry was passed from lip to lip
      during that evening! Amid the throng in which they moved, and wherever
      they lingered, an admiring coterie surrounded them. The husband was a
      strong man in the political world; had accepted a seat in congress more to
      gratify his friends than in accordance with his own wishes, and his party
      felt strengthened by his presence. His lady, ever distinguished at home,
      was now creating no small sensation at Washington; but&mdash;&ldquo;who are
      they?&rdquo; That all-absorbing question remained unanswered, even to the close
      of the evening, and they departed, leaving it still an &ldquo;open question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Judge W. had been seen conversing very familiarly with them, and an
      anxious company soon surrounded him, uttering, the query, &ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo;
       He informed them, that it was Mr. H. and his wife, Mrs. H., of M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.
      &ldquo;Oh! they all knew that, but what was their family?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my life, ladies,&rdquo; answered the good-natured Judge, &ldquo;I don't know;
      but if you will only wait until to-morrow evening, I will endeavor to find
      out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The task of postponing curiosity, though difficult, was, nevertheless,
      unavoidable; and the party broke up with a living hope, that ere another
      day had ended, the important query would be solved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you? H.,&rdquo; said the Judge to his friend the next day, as they sat
      conversing together in H.'s parlor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that is a hard question, Judge,&rdquo; replied H.&mdash;&ldquo;but perhaps Mary
      can answer that question better than I can;&rdquo; and calling his wife away
      from a boquet of flowers which she was arranging in a vase; he took her
      hand in his, as she leaned affectionately over his shoulder, and repeated
      the inquiry&mdash;&ldquo;Who am I, Mary?&mdash;the Judge wishes to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I can inform you, Judge,&rdquo; replied the wife, &ldquo;for he is not a whit
      changed since the day he taught me my first lesson in the 'free school' of
      L. He is Henry H.&mdash;formerly assistant teacher in a down-east <i>free
      school</i>, and now, the Hon. Henry H., of M.; moreover, the husband of
      Mary H., formerly a <i>factory girl</i> in that same town, but now, I need
      not tell you, Judge, the Hon. Mrs. H., also of M.; I have really become
      quite enamored of this title.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true, Judge,&rdquo; continued Mr. H., &ldquo;I first beheld Mary at a <i>free
      school</i>, taught her her first lesson, learned another from her eyes,
      and never became satisfied until I possessed the book, that throughout
      life I might continue to peruse the beauties of the page. But come, Judge,&mdash;now
      that you have traced our pedigree, give some account of yourself; from
      what ancient stock have you sprung?&mdash;Who are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am the son of Adam!&rdquo; (a laugh here interrupted him,) &ldquo;not the Adam
      spoken of in the Bible; I mean old Adam W., a <i>shoemaker</i> of Albany,
      who once used his stirrup rather lavishly upon me, and for which good
      office, I left him one fine morning, without bidding good by. I will not
      relate to you the many changes of fortune which befel me, until I found
      myself upon the <i>bench</i>, in a United States' court, instead of the <i>bench</i>
      in my father's shop. Suffice it to say, that my good parent, until his
      dying day, expressed the opinion that it was a good thing I took to the
      law early, for I was fit for no <i>useful purpose</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At Secretary E.'s on the next evening, a crowd surrounded the Judge, but
      all wore upon their countenances an air of incredulity&mdash;the Judge's
      story of the &ldquo;factory girl&rdquo; &ldquo;wouldn't go down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a fact, ladies,&rdquo; said the Judge; &ldquo;just about the time I was learning
      to make shoes these people were in the situations I tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They all pronounced the Judge a wag, and would not believe the story. A
      matron, more resolved than her friends to sift the truth of the matter,
      applied to Mrs. H., herself, and told her what a <i>fib</i> the Judge had
      been telling them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you it is true,&rdquo; replied Mrs. H.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but my dear, the best of families have been reduced,&rdquo; says Mrs.
      Enquiry, &ldquo;you are, no doubt, descended from the 'Pilgrim Fathers.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have every reason to believe so,&rdquo; answered Mrs. H. &ldquo;I told you so,&rdquo;
       said Mrs. Enquiry, exultingly, to her circle of acquaintances; &ldquo;she is a
      daughter of one of the 'Pilgrim Fathers.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wheels of government, which had well nigh ceased to move during the
      pendency of this important question, received a new impetus from the
      intelligence, and the republic was pronounced &ldquo;out of danger,&rdquo; for its
      &ldquo;heads of wisest censure&rdquo; had discovered <i>who they were!</i>&mdash;
    </p>
